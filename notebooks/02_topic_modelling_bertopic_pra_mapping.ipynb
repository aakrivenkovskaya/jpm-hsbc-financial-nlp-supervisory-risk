            "['thanks and good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion and delivered an rotce of  these results included  million of net investment securities losses in corporate before reviewing our results for the quarter lets talk about the recent bank failures jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so i will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm as you would expect we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows most significantly in the commercial bank business banking and awm regarding the deposit inflows at the firmwide level average deposits were down  quarteronquarter while endofperiod deposits were up  quarteronquarter – implying an intraquarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the march events we estimate that we have retained approximately  billion of these deposit inflows at quarterend its important to note that while the sequential periodend deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected our current full year nii outlook – which i will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here we expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarters inflows now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights we grew our ib fee wallet share consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up  yearonyear and credit continues to normalize but actual performance remains strong across the company on page  we have some more detail revenue of  billion was up  billion or  yearonyear nii ex markets was up  billion or  driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances nir ex markets was down  billion or  driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower ib fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume and markets revenue was down  million or  yearonyear expenses of  billion were up  million or  yearonyear driven by compensationrelated costs reflecting the annualization of last years headcount growth and wage inflation these results include the impact of the higher fdic assessment i mentioned last quarter which of course is unrelated to recent events and credit costs of  billion included net chargeoffs of  billion predominantly in card the net reserve build of  billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weightedaverage economic outlook on to balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  up about  basis points which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and aoci gains and in line with what we previously said we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of  billion in net repurchases back to shareholders now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  touching quickly on the health of us consumers and small businesses based on our data both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected but we continue to monitor their activity closely spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter moving to financial results ccb reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion which was up  yearonyear in banking and wealth management revenue was up  yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates average deposits were down  quarter onquarter in line with recent trends throughout the quarter we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect but were encouraged by what we are capturing in cds and our wealth management offerings client investment assets were down  yearonyear but up  quarteronquarter driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows in home lending revenue was down  yearonyear largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue moving to card services and auto – revenue was up  yearonyear largely driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income credit card spend was up  yearonyear card outstandings were up  driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization and in auto originations were  billion up  yearonyear expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were  billion reflecting reserve builds of  million in card and  million in home lending net chargeoffs were  billion up about  million yearonyear in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios next the cib on page  cib reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion investment banking revenue of  billion was down  yearonyear ib fees were down  we ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of  in advisory fees were down  compared to a strong first quarter last year our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down  for debt and  for equity in terms of the outlook the dynamics remain the same our pipeline is relatively robust but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook we expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging moving to markets total revenue was  billion down  yearonyear fixed income was flat rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in march credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies  emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year equity markets was down  driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in cash payments revenue was  billion up  yearonyear excluding the net impact of equity investments primarily a gain in the prior year it was up  with the growth driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances securities services revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to the commercial bank on page  commercial banking reported net income of  billion revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins payments revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher rates and gross investment banking revenue of  million was up  yearonyear on increased ma and bond underwriting from large deal activity expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation expense including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense average deposits were down  yearonyear and  quarteron quarter predominantly driven by continued attrition in nonoperating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances loans were up  yearonyear and  sequentially ci loans were up  quarteronquarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size in middle market banking higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization which is also leading to weakness in capex spending in corporate client banking utilization rates increased modestly quarteronquarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt cre loans were also up  sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments and given the recent focus on commercial real estate let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than  of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets and nearly twothirds of our loans are multifamily primarily in supply constrained markets finally credit costs of  million included a net reserve build of  million predominantly driven by what i mentioned upfront then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in china partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by compensation reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams higher revenuerelated compensation and the runrate impact of acquisitions for the quarter net longterm inflows were  billion led by fixed income and equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and overall client assets of  trillion were up  driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and longterm products and finally loans were down  quarteronquarter driven by lower securitiesbased lending while average deposits were down  turning to corporate on page  corporate reported net income of  million revenue was  million compared to a net loss of  million last year nii was  billion up  billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates nir was a loss of  million compared with a loss of  million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned earlier expenses of  million were down  million yearonyear and credit costs of  million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures next the outlook on page  we now expect  nii and nii ex markets to be approximately  billion this increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances note that in line with my comments at the outset recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the nii outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year i would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags we think a more sustainable nii ex markets runrate in the mediumterm is well below this quarters  billion as well as below the  billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance and while we dont know exactly when this lower runrate will be reached when it happens we believe it will be around the mids and of course as we mentioned last quarter this nii outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice investment portfolio decisions the dynamics of qt and rrp the trajectory of fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth separately its worth noting that markets nii may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects moving to expenses our outlook for  continues to be about  billion importantly this does not currently include the impact of the pending fdic special assessment and on credit we continue to expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be approximately  so to wrap up our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise we have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment', 'so jamie i was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with svb impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks in your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks but what are some of the changes that youre scenario planning for – whether its higher capital increase in fdic assessment fees and along those same lines how youre thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment', 'well i think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there look were hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place obviously when something happens like this you should adjust think about it so i think down the road there may be some limitations on heldtomaturity maybe more tlac for certain typesize banks and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure and stuff like that but it doesnt have to be a revamp of the whole system just recalibrating things the right way and i think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be the outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks and certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker so thats all it is we do expect higher capital from basel iv effectively and obviously theres going to be an fdic assessment – thatll be what it is', 'got it and just in terms of appetite for the buyback just given some of the', 'oh yeah', 'elevated macro uncertainties', 'well weve told you that were kind of penciling in  billion for this year obviously capital is more than that but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter were going to wait and see we dont mind keeping our powder dry and youve seen us do that with investment portfolios and were also going to do that with capital', 'thats great ill hop back into the queue thanks so much for taking my questions', 'okay operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies you may proceed', 'hey thanks good morning hey jeremy i was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower and maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update thank you', 'yeah sure so let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook so the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which as you mentioned is driven by a couple factors so the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook all else equal does take some pressure off the reprice and as you said were getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings the shortterm cd in particular is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches its been very attractive to yieldseeking customers so thats kind of working well and then on the asset side we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve which is helping and ill just remind you that at a conference in february i suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way but as jamies pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there we highlight them on the page and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the mediumterm we remain very focused on those', 'yeah and as a followup on the point about rate expectations coming now in and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy do you think its more just because inflations coming down do you think its because the feds just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there just kind of your general thinking about the other readthroughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy', 'well first of all i dont quite believe it so the fed has the rate curve the forward shortterm rate curve almost at  higher than what the market has so one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything we dont know what the rate curve is going to be in a year and so were quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that obviously the shortterm read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down so i think inflation will come down a little bit but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore the rate curve will have to go up a little bit', 'okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research you may proceed', 'hi thanks jeremy wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the nii revision and the lower rates paid assumption you mentioned the fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers what about the march events do the bank failures there that happened in march – in your view do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons or they intensify it industrywide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits how do those events influence your view of the reprice', 'yeah john its a really good question and weve obviously thought about that but as we sit here today i guess i have two answers to that one is its not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we dont see it as a major driver and i think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out its just a little too early to tell but from where we are right now the base case is no real impact', 'okay and then i wanted to ask jamie – theres a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending even jay powell mentioned that as a risk do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch thanks', 'yeah i wouldnt use the word credit crunch if i were you obviously theres going to be a little bit of tightening and most of that will be around certain real estate things and youve heard it from real estate investors already so i just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale it just makes the feds conditions be a little bit tighter it increases the odds of a recession – thats what that is its not like a credit crunch operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs you may proceed', 'hi good morning my first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions im wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate youre assuming in your reserve', 'yeah so erika as you know we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probabilityweight those the central case outlook from our research team hasnt actually changed but we felt that in line with what jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of march it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case so we did that which changed the weightedaverage expectation and i think that the weightedaverage peak unemployment that were using now is something like ', 'so as you think about all of what youve just told us – so  billion of nii this year and who knows when mediumterm is going to happen of mids the clear strength of the franchise producing  rotce in a quarter where your cet is  and a reserve that already reflects  unemployment as we think about recession and what jpmorgan can earn in a recession do you think you can hit  rotce even in  – assuming we do have a recession in  as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve', 'its a great question so i want to see how jeremy answers it', 'okay lets take a crack lets see what the boss thinks i think number one we believe have said and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a  through the cycle rotce franchise so number one number two as jamie always says we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios on the particular question of rotce expectations in  contingent on the particular economic outlook obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession i think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession but were a bank a very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns but we think even in a fairly severe recession well deliver very good returns – whether thats  or not is too much detail for now', 'thank you operator the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed', 'hey good morning maybe just a little bit on the deposit your thought process there youve seen some inflows why do you think that you lose them going forward and just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows do you see some pricing power for the larger banks', 'yeah a couple things there so first of all we dont know right the deposits just came in we dont know were guessing number two the deposits just came in so by definition these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us so its prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they wont be particularly stable number three theres a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and thats embedded in our assumptions and number four its a competitive market and its entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere so for all of those reasons were just being realistic about the stickiness of it', 'if i add i would say categorically theres no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in threemonth sixmonth ninemonth savings rates and then you have the online banks you got treasury bills you got money market funds theres no pricing power for the bank but obviously we all have different franchises and were all in a slightly different position', 'no fair – all fair points and maybe just a followup on johns question on the lending environment you talked about the industry likely pulling back are you changing your underwriting standards in any way just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity or how youre thinking about the loan environment', 'id say very modestly but we look at that all the time', 'yeah and we always say right we underwrite through the cycle and i think notably we didnt loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic and were not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale and that might make them leave our pre existing risk appetite but were not running around aggressively tightening standards right now', 'okay great thanks operator the next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets you may proceed', 'in your comments about your cet ratio obviously it came in strong at  youve got the gsib buffer obviously going up next year and we have the stress test coming this summer or in june – the results – which maybe will lead to banks including yours having a higher stress capital buffer where should we think about that cet ratio being by the end of the year do you think', 'yeah so a few things on there gerard so we have previously said that we were targeting  in the first quarter of  as a function of assuming an unchanged scb the increased gsib step and operating with a basispoint buffer so the point that jamie made a second ago in light of the environment basel iv dry powder you know who knows how well tweak that going forward but thats still our base case assumption specifically on the stress test contrary to what ive heard some people argue our ability to predict the scb ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited and youll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry so we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the scb but having said that for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged there are some tailwinds in there through the oci but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number so for planning purposes right now were assuming flat for scb and well know soon enough what that actual number is', 'sure and then just as a followup if i heard you correctly can you give us a little more color – i think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some oneoff credits i dont know if thats how you said it – theres some larger credits were they commercial real estate oriented were they commercial any more color there', 'no it wasnt commercial real estate it was just a couple of single name items in the corporate segment', 'leverage loantype items or just regular corporate credits', 'regular corporate credits id rather not get into too much detail', '…gerard sorry thanks', 'thank you operator the next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed', 'hi good morning i guess maybe one question jeremy you reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for jpm but obviously youre big players in the cre market just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on cre one how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy and how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks cant cut rates in the next year or two we will see a ton of more pain because of the refi wall thats coming up', 'yeah so ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure right so really the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily lending in supply constrained markets and i think its quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end higher price point nonrent controlled not supply constrained markets so our space is really quite different in that respect and i think thats a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long so of course we watch it very carefully and we dont assume that past performance predicts future results here but i think our multifamily lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things', 'can i just add also housing is in short supply in america its not massively oversupplied like you saw in ', 'yeah and then in terms of the office space as you know our exposure is quite small yes jamie has also mentioned all the refi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other our office exposure is quite modest very concentrated in class a buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy so again watching it there are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to but in the scheme of things for us not a big issue', 'and just as a follow up i think the other risk from higher for longer rates i think is this – the ability of the economy the financial markets to sustain a  less fed fund for a long period of time like what are the other areas youre watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one cre market being one are you worrying – worried about nonbanks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the nonbanks if rates dont get cut and if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the nonbanks', 'yeah so id like to answer that so there is a risk of higher rates for longer and dont just think of just the fed funds rate because i think you should – for our planning – id be thinking more about it could be  and then think about the five and tenyear rate which could be  and i think if those things happen – im not saying theyre going to happen – i just think people should prepare for them they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond peoples expectations you had the gilt problem in london you had some of the banks here people need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer if and when that happens it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates for those who are too exposed to refi risk those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy i say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company your business your investment pools et cetera thats answer number one number two is it will not come back to jpmorgan okay while we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks it is very – we think – its very very secure that does not mean it wont come back to other credit providers', 'got it very helpful thank you operator the next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hey jeremy you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets you said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending and im just wondering as part of your  billion increased nii guide are you assuming better loan spreads and on the topic of loan pricing why arent your credit card yields going higher than where they are today thanks', 'yeah mike so i think yeah youre referring to my comments that i made in the commercial bank about the fact that the larger corporate segment within the commercial bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets that is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in nii guidance theres a lot of odds and ends in there but the major drivers are the ones that i called out and to be honest i havent actually specifically checked whats happening with card yields i would imagine that theyve gone up a little bit in line with rates but i dont know we should follow up here', 'all right and then one for you jamie i guess taking the  foot level i guess when you look at asset liability management or alm – you could call this nightmare on alm street and youve seen some big problems at banks and i guess how would you evaluate yourself i guess with this  billion higher nii guide it probably is good but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice jpm shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly', 'well its two really different questions so weve been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while and how we invest our portfolio what our expectations are our stress testing the stress test – the ccar stress test as you know had rates going down i always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen so weve been quite conservative ourselves and we dont mind continuing to do that because i remind people that having excess capital you havent lost it its kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time when the time comes and look we like to help the system when it needs help if we can reasonably and were not the only ones you saw a lot of banks do that and i was proud of them i think all of us did the right thing whether ultimately it works out or not well you could secondguess that when it happens but the fact is i think people want to help the system and this whole banking thing was bad for banks and i knew that the second i saw the headline and then you had credit suisse we want healthy community banks we want healthy regional banks we want to help them get through this we have youll remember mike as you point out we have the best financial system the worlds ever seen that does not mean it wont have problems doesnt mean there shouldnt be changes made but i think its reasonable for people to help each other in times of need and we all did that – all of us – did that during covid all of us did that – if you could those who could – did it during the great financial crisis and i would expect people to do that going forward', 'hey jamie your ceo letter said the banking crisis isnt over so what do you mean by that or was that dated two weeks later are you talking contagion or what', 'yeah so its just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands in terms of too much interest rate exposure too much atm too much uninsured deposits and so there may be additional bank failures something like that which we dont know but youre going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers a lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward youve already seen things calm down quite a bit particularly in deposit flows warren buffett was on tv talking about that he would bet  million – i dont know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in america that hes willing to bet his own money and of course you know hes a very bright man so this crisis is not  it will pass and the one thing i pointed out is when i answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared they shouldnt pray that they dont go up they should prepare for them going up and if it doesnt happen serendipity', 'all right thank you', 'i do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your nonmarkets nii', 'betsy did we just lose you i feel like you just dropped', 'no hear me hello', 'go ahead', 'okay so i just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your nii because your nii guide is assuming the forward curve if i understand correctly so in the event that you get that higher for longer just how much does that impact nii ex markets because im trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits but if we have higher for longer shouldnt we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down is that – thats the question', 'go ahead jeremy and then ill go', 'sure so betsy your question is very good and i would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year it was pretty clear that we were very assetsensitive certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward ear type measure you also obviously know that our current ear actually shows a slight negative number so a tiny bit liability sensitive and i wont get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the shortterm but the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year and at this level of rates the relationship between our shortterm nii evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment its quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of again what ive alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits which is not in fact a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve so thats why were emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the nii outlook yeah', 'yeah so ill just add so next quarter we all kind of know already two quarters out we know a little bit less three quarters out we know a little bit less and  we know very little that number you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that were talking about for  is not based upon an implied curve its based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range and youre absolutely correct you could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that but remember higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession stagflation lower volumes so i wouldnt look at that as higher for longer is a positive it might be a slight positive on that line it would probably would be a negative on other lines', 'yeah got it okay thats super helpful to understand how you think through that and then the followup is just on the buybacks so do i take your comments to mean that youre on pause now and if thats the case what would be the driver of restarting', 'yeah no were not on pause now were doing a little bit now we obviously have a lot of excess capital we also like to buy our stock when its cheap not just when its available and were also peering ahead looking at those little bit of storm clouds so were going to be kind of cautious so were going to make this decision every day we also dont like to tell the market what were doing just so you know', 'yeah and then can you give us any sense of what basel iv endgame means to you in your rwas how much should we be baking in for those', 'yeah betsy we really dont have any new information there right i mean i think clearly if you go back like a year we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it closer to capital neutral i think now it feels like its likely to be worse than that hopefully its not too much worse than that and i would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers so when the npr comes thats only going to be a part of it theres going to be other pieces – the holistic review and its going to take a lot of time to phase in and were going to have time to adjust so well know when we know', 'got it', 'and there were supposed – i just remembered there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy which are getting smaller the gsifi was supposed to be adjusted for that so it may very – were expecting it go up but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldnt go up and jpmorgan – theres so much capital i mean so you cant look at jpmorgan and say well its a capital issue and even the banks by the way when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble they have plenty of capital their issue wasnt capital it was other things and so im just hoping regulators are very thoughtful and the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because ive made it clear – i can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan if possible thats how much capital is now being required for loans', 'this is based on the current rule set', 'yeah because the market is pricing holds the market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them im talking about just loans only so thats why youre seeing a lot of capital go to – i mean a lot of credit go to nonbanks and dramatically by the way rapidly and dramatically and so if youre a regulator you should be looking at it and saying do i want that is that a good thing for the system if you believe its a good thing for the system raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system thats fine if thats what they want thats fine but they should do it with a forethought not accidentally', 'i like the nii from loans better than the gain on sale so ill prefer the former not the latter but thanks appreciate it', 'yes operator thank you the next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open', 'thank you so you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the kneejerk reaction which you addressed earlier im curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react now my point my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance they can do that in a lot of different ways move it treasuries money market extra accounts whatever the issue the question i have for you is on the corporate side have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or cfos are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to and i appreciate your warren buffett comments', 'yeah glenn in short we really havent seen big changes to speak of and i do think its just worth saying – i think youre sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits thats obviously very different if youre talking about large balances of nonoperating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances which is of course like core banking business for all of us', 'when we saw it in commercial banking payments investment banking and custody you did see money move – or i would call excess cash was moved out but they have options what i would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies middle market companies et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there you have your money there youre getting more and more competitive in rates and thats why i think you see lot of regional banks – theyve got sticky middle market deposits if i lent you  million and you have  million youre probably going to leave it at my bank and they also are more competitive on the rate for that so i think you shouldnt be looking at deposit like one class – theres a whole bunch of different types and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on but i think they have already – as the fed has raised rates youve already seen – thats the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers', 'interesting just followup the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that youre exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations whats different than what youve already been doing for the last  years', 'weve got our smartest people were going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for jpmorgan thats the difference and weve been doing it but theres securitizations there are partnerships youre seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies and i expect that were going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time and well shed certain assets too', 'yeah thanks jamie operator our final question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may proceed', 'good morning you guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances and i was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago and i guess is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought', 'yeah so the story there is kind of the same story weve been talking about for a while its just a matter of degree so we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as wed had prepandemic which i think happened last quarter and then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve peraccount because we also have seen some account growth and that continues to happen and so also to mikes question earlier were seeing a higher yield there as well so and on your question of whether its good or bad obviously theres a point at which the consumers have too much leverage we dont see that yet so', 'its normalization', 'its a good thing for us', 'okay and then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter and in the past youve talked about really just going securitybysecurity looking for kind of pricing opportunities is that kind of what drove it again this quarter or is there some kind of broader overarching…', 'thatll be every quarter for the rest of our lives sell what we find rich and we buy what we think is dear', 'cheap', 'cheap', 'okay all right thank you operator we have no further questions jamie dimon chairman

line with the reorganization that was announced in january turning back to this quarter cib reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion investment banking revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear ib fees were up  yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of  in advisory fees were down  driven by fewer large completed deals underwriting fees were up significantly benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up  and equity up  in terms of the outlook while were encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year similarly while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced ma in the quarter it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment payments revenue was  billion down  yearonyear as deposit margin normalization and depositrelated client credits were largely offset by higher feebased revenue and deposit balances moving to markets total revenue was  billion down  yearonyear fixed income was down  driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prioryear quarter partially offset by strong results in securitized products equity markets was flat securities services revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear expenses of  billion were down  yearonyear predominantly driven by lower legal expense moving to the commercial bank on page  commercial banking reported net income of  billion revenue of  billion was up  year onyear driven by higher noninterest revenue gross investment banking and markets revenue of  million was up  yearonyear with increased ib fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter payments revenue of  billion was down  yearonyear driven by lower deposit margins and balances largely offset by fee growth net of higher depositrelated client credits expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by higher compensation reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense average deposits were down  yearonyear primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down  quarteronquarter reflecting seasonally lower balances loans were flat quarteronquarter ci loans were down  reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious and cre loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity finally credit costs were a net benefit of  million including a net reserve release of  million and net chargeoffs of  million then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was down  yearonyear excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year revenue was up  driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels partially offset by lower nii due to deposit margin compression expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation including revenuerelated compensation continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the jp morgan asset management china acquisition as well as higher distribution fees for the quarter longterm net inflows were  billion led by equities and fixed income aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and client assets of  trillion were up  yearonyear driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows and finally loans were down  quarteronquarter and deposits were flat turning to corporate on page  corporate reported net income of  million revenue was  billion up  billion yearonyear nii was  billion up  million yearonyear driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates nir was a net loss of  million the current quarter included net investment securities losses of  million compared with net securities losses of  million in the prior year quarter expenses of  billion were up  million yearonyear predominately driven by the increase to the fdic special assessment to finish up we have the outlook on page  we now expect nii ex markets to be approximately  billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end our total nii guidance remains approximately  billion which implies a decrease in our markets nii guidance from around  billion to around  billion the primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the markets business and as a reminder changes in markets nii are generally revenue neutral our outlook for adjusted expense is now about  billion reflecting the increase to the fdic special assessment i mentioned upfront and on credit we continue to expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be below  finally you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around  this year absent discrete items which can vary quite a bit the driver of this change is the firms adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about  above the effective tax rate this is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past for the avoidance of doubt these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income were just mentioning this to help with your models so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards nii normalization begins while we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios the economic geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way', 'so a couple of questions here just one jamie could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of midcycle it felt like pre ccar and also help us understand how youre thinking about where that payout ratio that dividend payout ratio range should be because over the past several years its been somewhere between  and  and so is this suggesting we could be towards the higherend of that range or even expanding above that and then i also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the cet at  here the minimum is  i know its – we have to wait for basel iii endgame reproposal to come through and all that but should we be expecting that hey were going to hold  cet until we know all these rules thanks', 'yeah so betsy before i answer the question i want to say something on behalf of all of us at jpmorgan and me personally thrilled to have you on this call for those that dont know betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and its a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here but betsy in particular the amount of respect we have not just in your work but in your character over the last  plus years has been exceptional so on behalf of all of us i just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here and so youre asking a pertinent question so were earning a lot of money our capital cup runneth over and thats why weve increased the dividend and if youre asking me what wed like to do is to pay out something like a third a third of normalized earnings of course its hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are but we dont mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes a little bit behind that sometimes if i could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance et cetera i think the far more important question is the  so look at the  im going to oversimplify it that basically will prepare us for the total basel endgame today roughly the specifics dont matter that much', 'remember we can do a lot of things to change that in the shortrun or the longrun but it looks like basel iii endgame may not be the worst case itll be something less than that so obviously when and if that happens it would free up a lot of capital and im going to say in the order of  billion or something like that and yes weve always had the capital hierarchy the same way which is were going to use capital to build our business first i mean pay the dividend – steady dividend build the business and if we think its appropriate to buy back stock were continuing to buy back stock at  billion a quarter sic i personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices i think youve all heard me talk about the world things like that so waiting in preparation for basel hopefully well know something later and then we can be much more specific with you all but in the meantime theres also – its very important to put in mind there are shortterm uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our cet too so you may see us do things in the shortrun that will increase earnings increase capital that are using up that capital jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading we could do things now so its a great position to be in were going to be very very patient i urge all the analysts to keep in mind excess capital is not wasted capital its earnings in store we will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course', 'excellent thank you so much', 'and yeah betsy i just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well and just a very minor edit to jamies answer i think he just misspoke when he said  billion a year in buybacks the trajectory is  billion', 'oh sorry  billion a quarter yeah', 'a quarter otherwise i have nothing to add to jamies very complete answer but welcome back betsy', 'okay thank you so much and appreciate it looking forward to seeing you at investor day on may th', 'excellent us too operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global you may proceed', 'hey good morning jeremy can you speak to the trends youre seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter if theres been any change have you seen that migration start to slow or not', 'yeah good question jim i think the simplest and best answer to that is not really so as weve been saying for a while migration from checking and savings to cds is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise that continues we continue to capture that moneyinmotion at a very high rate were very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that were seeing im aware that theres a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting weve looked at that data we see some evidence that maybe its slowing a little bit were quite cautious on that we really sort of dont think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  that youre not going to see ongoing migration and frankly we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yieldseeking behavior so its quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues so i would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there', 'okay and just a followup on that and just sort of bigger picture on nii is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook is it migration is it the forward curve is it balances it sounds like its migration but just id be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside', 'yeah so i mean i think the drivers of lets say whats embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter meaning its the current yield curve which is a little bit stale now but the snap from quarterend had roughly three cuts in it so its the current yield curve its what i just said the expectation of ongoing internal migration there is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth which while its a little bit less than it was in prior years is still a tailwind there we expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down so thats a little bit of a headwind at the margin and then theres obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice which we always say were going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace and you know this obviously but in a world where weve got something like  billion of deposits paying effectively zero relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the nii run rate by a lot so the error bands here are pretty wide and were always going to stick with our mantra which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing', 'right okay great thanks for the color', 'thanks jeremy you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the card growth youve had more reserve build we didnt see that this quarter is that just kind of seasonal and would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of card growth and reserve build needs', 'yeah john so in short yes to both questions so yes the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of card yes we still expect  card loan growth for the full year and yes that still means that all else equal we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth obviously theres the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on and were not speaking to that one way or the other so if guys have your own opinions about that thats fine but were narrowly just saying that based on the card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that we do expect build in the back half of the year', 'okay got it and then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the markets nii that outlook being revised down by  billion but revenue neutral i guess the obvious thing is there theres typically an offset in fee income and you dont guide to that but the idea would be the way youre structuring trades the way the balance sheet is evolving theres some offset that youd expect in markets fees from the lower markets nii correct', 'that is exactly right and specifically whats going on here is theres shift between onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within markets and you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related so fundamentally you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet noninterest bearing highfunding expense negative for nii or we receive that in total return form through derivatives exactly the same economics no impact on nii so that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral its second order effects but they change the geography quite a bit and thats what happened this quarter and thats why weve been emphasizing for some time that the nii ex markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing', 'got it thank you', 'thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may proceed', 'hey good morning i guess just in terms of jeremy when you think about the outlook for the economy i would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base both commercial and consumer and when we think about higherforlonger maybe the economy is too strong so we dont get any rate cuts are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback youre getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up and i appreciate all the macro risks that jamie has pointed out but im just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what youre seeing today from the customers', 'i would say consumer customers are fine the unemployment is very low home prices are up stock prices are up the amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low but the extra money of the lowerincome folks is running out – not running out but normalizing and you see credit normalizing a little bit and of course higherincome folks still have more money theyre still spending it so whatever happens the customer is in pretty good shape and theyre – if they – you go into a recession theyll be in pretty good shape businesses are in good shape if you look at it today their confidence is up their order books are up their profits are up but what i caution people these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending a lot of qe et cetera and so we dont really know whats going to happen and i also want to look at the year look at two years or three years all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place our elections et cetera so were in good shape – were okay right now it does not mean were okay down the road and if you look at any inflection point being okay in the current time is always true that was true in  it was true in any time weve had it so i just – im just on the more cautious side how people feel and confidence levels and all that that doesnt necessarily stop you from having an inflection point and so everything is okay today but youve got to be prepared for a range of outcomes which we are and the other thing i want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and nii and credit losses its – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios but the generally accepted economic scenario which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the fed but these numbers have always been wrong you have to ask the question what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession et cetera then all these numbers change i just dont think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens and i just think the chance of happening is higher than other people i dont know the outcome we dont want to guess the outcome ive never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history', 'thats helpful and just tied to that as we look at commercial real estate both for jp and for the economy overall is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office cre like how would you characterize the health of the cre market thank you', 'yeah so ill put it into two buckets okay first of all were fine weve got good reserves against office we think our multifamily is fine jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want but if you think of real estate theres two pieces if rates go up think of the yield curve the whole yield curve not fed funds but the year bond rate it goes up  all assets all assets every asset on the planet including real estate is worth  less well obviously that creates a little bit of stress and strain and people have to roll those over and finance it more thats not just true for real estate its true for everybody and that happens leveraged loans real estate will have some effect the second thing is the why does that happen if that happens because we have a strong economy well thats not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets if that happens because we have stagflation well thats the', 'worst case all of a sudden you are going to have more vacancies you are going to have more companies cutting back you are going to have less leases it will affect – including multifamily that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people havent really experienced since  so i just put in the back of your mind the why is important the interest rates are important the recession is important if things stay where they are today we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace everyone will – the real estate will muddle through obviously it will be idiosyncratic if youre in different cities and different types and b versus a buildings and all of that but people muddle through they wont muddle through under higher rates with the recession that would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if in fact that happens', 'helpful thank you so much', 'hi good morning given that your response to betsys question is that  cet today prepares you for basel iii endgame as written you earn  on – without the fdic assessment ahead of investor day i guess six weeks from now or a week from now as we think about that  throughthecycle target if youre at the right capital level per you guys where are you overearning today', 'right so interesting framing of the question erika so i think weve been pretty consistent about where were overearning right so obviously one major area is that were overearning in deposit margin especially in consumer and thats sort of why were expecting sequential declines in nii why weve talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid so i think thats probably the single biggest source of lets call it excess earnings currently you also have heard jamie say that were overearning in credit i mean wholesale chargeoffs have been particularly low but we have builds for that so in the current run rate a bit less clear the extent of what were earning and in card of course while chargeoffs are now close to normalized essentially we did go through an extended period of chargeoffs being very low by historical standards although that was coupled with nii also being low by historical standards so from a bottom line perspective its not entirely clear what the net of that was but broadly its really deposit margin thats the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative embedded in your question i think is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the  cet in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about investor day i was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at investor day in light of potential updates of the basel iii endgame given that the single most important factor for that  is how much denominator expansion do we see through the basel iii endgame at the rate were going we wont actually know that much more about that by investor day so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what ive said in the past which is that whatever it is its going to be very good our returns in absolute terms very good in relative terms we will optimize we will seek to reprice we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability but given the structure of the rule as proposed at least a lot of this cannot be optimized away and so in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind', 'got it and just as a followup question you mentioned that the current curve that you set your nii outlook upon is stale i guess does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing and obviously no june cut no september cut and a tossup in december which should matter for this year as we think about that  billion if we price rate cuts out totally does that matter much given it seems like june is the only one that would', 'yeah sorry erika so just quick things on this one lets focus on nii ex not on total nii so id anchor you to the  billion number two if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the ear like be my guest its like as good as an approach as any but i would just once again remind you of the  billion of deposits paying practically zero that very small changes there can make a big difference and weve got other factors weve got the impact of qt on deposit balances et cetera et cetera et cetera so we want to make sure that we dont get too precise here were giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and its going to be where its going to be', 'which we know are going to be wrong', 'thanks good morning jeremy i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments when you talked about well have hopes and expectations for the investment banking pipeline that continued to move along we obviously saw the good movement in ecm and dcm and the lag in advisory can you just talk about that you mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to ma on like gonogo type of feel and conversation levels and then what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of ipo activity in the ecm markets thanks', 'sure yeah let me take the ipo first so we have been a little bit cautious there some cohorts and vintages of ipos had performed somewhat disappointingly i think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter so i think were seeing better ipo performance obviously equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days but in general we have a lot of support there and that always helps dialogue is quite good a lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms multinationals carveout type things so dialogue is good valuation environment is better like sort of decent reasons for optimism there but of course with ecm theres always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter and so we cautioned a little bit there about pullforward which is even more acute i think on the dcm side given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter so thats a factor', 'and then the question of ma i think is probably the single most important question not only because of its impact on ma but also because of its knockon impact on dcm through acquisition financing and so on and there is the wellknown kind of regulatory headwinds there and thats definitely having a bit of a chilling effect i dont know ive heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pentup deal demand who knows how important politics are in all this so i dont know', 'little bit cautious about the pullforward dynamic a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds and in the end were just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here', 'got it and i guess ill just stick on the theme of capital markets and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in ficc i think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place and i know thats impossible to guide on but just maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business and do you feel like this is the type of environment where given that lingering uncertainty about rates clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how theyre positioning portfolios thanks', 'yeah really good question i would say in general that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the markets revenue pool and i think that together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth is one of the reasons that the overall level of markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the prepandemic period and well that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like “oh is this sustainable might there be downside here” for now that does seem to be the new normal and i do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates that not only affects the rates business but it affects the foreign exchange business it generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting and so all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth so i think that – those are some of the themes on the market side at the margin and yeah well see how the rest of the year goes but it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally i would say operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo you may proceed', 'hi jamie im just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your ceo letter im sure the  pages – i can see you put a lot of effort into that and its appreciated but you talked about scenarios tail risk macro risk geopolitical risk and all that over several years if not weeks or months i get it on the other hand the firm is investing so much more outside the us whether its commercial or some digital banking consumer or wholesale payments so im just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words and specifically how is global wholesale payments going you mentioned youre in  countries you do business a lot more how is that business in particular doing thanks', 'right mike so im sorry to tell you that jamie actually left us because hes at a leadership offsite thats why he was here remote so i think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for jamie here', 'i think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook part of the point there is to note that the us is not isolated from that if we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations thats not only a problem outside of the us that affects the global economy and therefore the us and therefore our corporate customers et cetera et cetera and in that context keeping in mind what we always say that we invest throughthecycle that we sort of we dont go into countries and then leave countries et cetera obviously we adjust around the edges we manage risks we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment but broadly the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how weve always operated and in terms of the wholesale payments business its going great were taking share theres been a lot of innovation there a lot of investment in technology a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world and yeah im sure well give you more color in other settings on that but its a good story its a nice thing to see', 'just as a follow up to that then why is it doing great in terms of wholesale payments given such the – the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes everything else why is wholesale payments doing great', 'well i think one of the things about payments businesses is that in some sense they are – i mean recession proof is probably the wrong word and in any case were not dealing with the recession were talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world and thats a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what so thats one piece but i think the other piece is that our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours is one of the key things separating us in this business right now and so we are seeing the benefits of that', 'alright thank you', 'thank you your commentary with kens questions were great and clear on investment banking for the near term in this year i have a bigger picture question in terms of youre always so good in spelling out where youre overearning do you feel like youre underearning on the investment banking side and i just use some of your own numbers from the past of like the market has added like  trillion of equity market cap and  trillion of fixed income market cap last  years yet the wallet is like  plus below the year average so is there just a bigger upside and its just a matter of when not if', 'yeah glenn in short yes i mean i think were not shy about saying that were underearning in investment banking right now clearly were below cycle averages as you point out weve been talking about when do we get back to the prepandemic wallet but as you know i mean on this point what it was like march  right was the beginning of the pandemic so its like four years ago at this point so there has been gdp growth especially in nominal terms during that period and you would expect the wallet to growth with that so i do think theres meaningful upside in the investment banking fee wallet as ive noted there are some headwinds i think particularly in ma but over time you would hope that the amount of ma is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment so you could see some mean reversion there and yeah so thats why were sort of leaning in were engaging with clients were making sure that were appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share', 'cool maybe one other followup youre always investing you clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do but relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat do you envision environment or maybe i should rephrase that what type of environment would have jp morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that youve been going through', 'sure so i think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but im going to say it anyway is that there are some like autogovernors in this right like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue whether its volumerelated commissions whether its incentive compensation whether its other things so there are some autocorrecting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline so thats point one point two is that independently of the environment we are always looking for efficiencies its a little bit hard to see it and in a world where were guiding to i guess now with the special assessment added  billion of expenses its hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath but that is part of the dna of the company that does happen in bau all the time as we grind things out get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency and i think to get to the heart of your question which is okay in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions and in the end i think thats a little bit about what that environment is really like so if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle would we change our longterm strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience throughthecycle no we wouldnt could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices yes but that would be because the throughthecycle analysis has changed for some reason i just dont see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged simply because of the business cycle in the shortterm', 'awesome thank you', 'good morning you mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet and we just see the trading assets going up q which is probably seasonal but also up a lot yearoveryear but not necessarily translate into higher revenues and i know they dont like match up necessarily each quarter but maybe just elaborate like how youre leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time', 'yeah sure so let me break this question down into a couple of different parts so i think what jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term and what hes kind of saying is that in a moment where youre carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively shortduration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason and what might be thought of as a tactical sense so hes just pointing out that thats an option that you have and the extent to which this quarters increase in markets rwa is a reflection of that maybe a little bit but probably not i agree with you that its hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and rwa to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there but for sure one thing thats true is the higher run rate of the markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses so as you well know we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity balance sheet deployment gsib capacity utilization et cetera in the markets business and we dont just chase revenue we go after returns fully measured and thats part of the dna and we continue to do it and we will so – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints and obviously the environment is complex so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always but big picture we are clearly in a very very strong capital position which is in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the basel iii endgame is final we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities', 'got it and then just separately within the consumer card businesses you highlighted volumes were up  yearoveryear obviously still a very strong piece any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category either overall or among certain segments thank you', 'maybe a little bit jamie already alluded somewhat to this so i do think spend is fine but not boomy broadly speaking i would say you can look at it a lot of different ways inflation cohorts et cetera but when you kind of triangulate that you get back to this kind of flattish picture there is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary and i think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts within that theres obviously a probability distribution and theres some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes and there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up theyre down and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately and what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up so i think thats maybe an economic indicator of sorts although this portion of the population is small enough that im not sure the reader cost is that big but it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal postpandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets and thats sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective', 'hey gerard how are you doing', 'good thanks notwithstanding your guys outlook for uncertainty and of course jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier can you guys share or can you share with us the color on whats going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter its not reflecting i dont think a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world and any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well', 'right so i think whats true about spreads in general just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space is that they are exceptionally tight so im sure thats reversed a little bit in the last few days but broadly throughout the quarter weve really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit you even see that a little bit in our oci this quarter where losses in oci that we wouldve had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio so broadly sort of in keeping with the big runup that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets that i think has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does and that theres a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned and as we have in the past we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we dont like the terms we never compromise on structure there so you are seeing a little bit of that i think that away from the leverage lending space in the broader ci space there was a moment a few months ago where i think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending youre seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads i dont know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks and it was little bit hard to observe in any case but i would say broadly the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot', 'thank you and i guess as a tiein to that question and answer weve read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies can you give us some color on what youre seeing there both as a competitor but also as a client of jpmorgan how you balance the two out where you may see them bidding on business that youd like but at the same time youre supporting their business', 'right yeah i mean i think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit private equity community youre talking about different parts of the capital structure but we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas and thats part of the franchise and its all good at some level but narrowly on private credit it is interesting to observe whats going on there so i would say for us the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually its not so much like oh is it private credit or is it syndicated lending its what does it take to be good at this stuff and what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that were very good at in each individual silo so you need underwriting skill structuring skill origination distribution secondary trading risk appetite credit analysis capabilities and this is what we do and were really good at it and increasingly what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit as the private credit space gets bigger it starts to make sense to actually bring in some colenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks i mean even if you have the capital you just may not want the concentration risk and so in a funny way the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space and at the same time the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works so were watching it the competitive dynamics are interesting certainly theres some pressure in some areas but we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none and so were looking forward to the future here', 'good morning a couple of questions on the first republic acquisition some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun and im glad to see that jamie dimon validated that in his annual letter when you look at the first quarter it annualizes out to  billion  billion above the  billion that jamie published in the letter i know you dont want to extrapolate that but can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that because this quarter did see expenses come down to  million down from  million and then secondly is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and thats why you dont want to extrapolate the  billion  billion so thats my first question', 'okay thanks charlie and im going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much first republic specific guidance but i do think that the kind of framework youre articulating is broadly correct so let me go through the pieces so yes the current quarters results annualized to more than the  billion jamie talked about yes a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of shortdated assets so thats part of the reason that you see that converge yes its also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration obviously as i think as i mentioned to you last quarter from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect theres maybe an embedded question in there too about we had talked about  billion of integration expense and the integration is real the expenses are real and also the time spent on that is quite real its a lot of work for a lot of people its going well but were not done yet and it takes a lot of effort but broadly i think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons one is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly and of course its worked out to your point quite a bit better than that and therefore the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher and that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers its probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative they were based on kind of more typical type of bank ma assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the fdic and so on and so forth so yeah i think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question thanks charlie', 'as a quick followup where are the next homeruns going to come from and this is more strategic beyond just jpmorgan but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures whether its this year or next year and opportunities to pick those up but what youre seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures mnuchins buying of nycb is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks so do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit and as part of that do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks so thats my question', 'right okay charlie theres a lot in there and to be honest i just dont love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape im not going to bother debating that with you but i guess let me just try to say a couple of things doing my best to answer your question as we talked about earlier we have a lot of capital and as jamie says the capital is earnings in store and right now we dont see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital but if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the basel iii endgame we will be well positioned to deploy it i think embedded there is also sort of a question about the fdic and the fdics attitude towards different types of bidders and obviously theres a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth and i think probably we can all agree that its better all else equal for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong but the mechanics of how you do that when youre talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated so i guess thats probably as much as i have on that', 'alright thank you', 'thanks operator we have no further

republicrelated gain of  million which was previously disclosed in the k on page  we have more on our firstquarter results the firm reported revenue of  billion up  billion or  yearonyear nii ex markets was down  million or  driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in ccb this was predominantly offset by higher card revolving balances the impact of securities activity including from prior quarters as well as higher wholesale deposits nir ex markets was up  billion or  and excluding the significant item i just mentioned was up  largely on higher asset management fees lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees and markets revenue was up  billion or  expenses of  billion were up  million or  largely driven by compensation including growth in employees across the front office and technology higher brokerage and distribution fees as well as marketing and legal expense the quarter also reflected a  million release of the fdic special assessment accrual compared with a  million increase in the prior quarter credit costs were  billion with net chargeoffs of  billion and a net reserve build of  million we have more details on the reserve build on page  with this quarters reserve build the firms total allowance for credit losses is  billion lets take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook which was in effect at the end of the quarter but in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our cecl framework as a result the weightedaverage unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is  up from  last quarter driving the  million increase in the allowance so with that in mind the consumer build of  million was driven by changes in the weightedaverage macroeconomic outlook the wholesale build of  million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity as well as changes in the outlook in addition its important to note that the increase in the allowance is not to any meaningful degree driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio which remains largely in line with expectations with that lets go to the balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  down  basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and oci gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher rwa this quarter the firm distributed  billion of capital to shareholders which reflects  billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend which has been increased to  per share this quarters higher rwa is primarily driven by overall business growth in markets and some seasonal effects now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy despite the

be in line with our previous guidance of approximately  so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course the focus right now is on the future which is obviously unusually uncertain but no matter what outcomes eventually materialize we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients the markets and the broader economy and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment and with that lets open the line for qa', 'good morning jeremy wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on and given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale and can you just talk through how thats also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations thanks', 'sure ken so i mean at a high level i would say that obviously some of the salient news flow is quite recent so weve done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side i think on the consumer side the thing to check is the spending data and to be honest the main thing that we see there what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs so ironically thats actually somewhat supportive all else equal but i think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions in terms of our corporate clients obviously theyve been reacting to the changes in tariff policy and at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the investment banking pipeline outlook towards more shortterm work optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how theyre going to respond to the current environment so as a result i think we would characterize what were hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a waitandsee attitude i do think you see obvious differences across sectors some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve and also across the size of the clients i think smaller clients small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged i think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage so thats a little bit our read of the situation right now but certainly a bit of a waitandsee attitude its hard to make longterm decisions right now and so well see how that plays out', 'yeah and just one question on the nii ex markets holding at  billion can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just whats the new curve youre using which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before thanks', 'yeah thats a good question ken youre right so if you remember last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve i think latest curve has something like three cuts and so weve talked a lot obviously about how we are asset sensitive you now see our ear disclosed in the supplement and probably our empirical ear is a little bit higher than our modeled ear as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in consumer so when you put that together all else equal the drop in the weightedaverage iorb which is about  basis points should produce a notable headwind in our nii ex markets', 'in the curve basically', 'this is guaranteed not to happen', 'so thats mechanically just flowing through the curve so yeah your question is that given that why are you not revising down and the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually our number is a tiny bit lower its just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook but we do have some offsets so we have some balance effects that are favorable you will have noted that i talked about higher wholesale deposit balances for example we see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in cds and in wholesale the other thing is that youll recall we talked before about having a placeholder in our nii outlook for the potential impact of the card late fee rule weve now removed that so thats a little bit of an offset as well so thats kind of how you get to unchanged even though clearly all else equal the lower expected frontend rates are a headwind operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs you may proceed', 'yes good morning this question is for jamie jamie you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence but jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence the equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn so i guess just the question here is can you doubleclick on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe doubleclick on jeremys statement that the banking system should be a source of strength', 'i just – before jamie answers that erika i just want to make one brief comment which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says in other words banks doing their job to support the economy thats not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not like obviously a recessionary environment as ive frequently said all else equal is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective were talking about the financial strength of banks balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment', 'everyone trades stocks in a different way so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy if the economy gets worse credit losses will go up volumes can change deal curves can change and were not predicting all of that what i would say is our excellent economist michael feroli i called him this morning specifically to ask him how theyre looking at their forecast today they think its about  for a recession so ill just refer to that obviously if theres a recession credit losses will go up and other factors will change too and i think the one thing ill add to what jeremy said is – and i dont usually pay that much attention to anecdotes but this time i am and i think youre going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the sp by  so its – now its up  as opposed to up  my guess is that will be zero and negative  probably in the next month and then youre going to hear  companies report and theyre going to tell you what their guidance is my guess is a lot will remove it theyre going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers their base their earnings their cost their tariffs its different for every company but i assume youll see that and anecdotally a lot of people are not doing things because of this theyre going to wait and see and thats ma thats ma with middle market companies thats peoples hiring plans and stuff like that so people have to adjust to this new environment and i think well see what it is i just also want to point out just to – so you can round it up this is to make you feel comfortable not uncomfortable when covid hit unemployment went from like  to  in a couple of months and we had to add to reserves in a twomonth period of  billion and then to show you how stupid cecl is in the three month – three quarter period we took down the  billion so just – that just sizes up a bad recession if its a mild recession it will be less than that if its a really bad recession it will be more than that either way we can handle it and serve our clients earnings wont be great and the stocks will go down which i look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock', 'got it and a second followup question and i dont disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks its just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience and to that point the second question is on the reserve jeremy you mentioned a weightedaverage unemployment rate of  i think thats above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario how should we think about any incremental builds from here and what you are going – obviously deterioration in the outlook but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here', 'yeah erika its a good question but the truth is theres just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves which is generally not a thing that we do anyway as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the indiscernible forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard no landing barely any increase in unemployment given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment which is what led to the increase and what led to the build', 'we use this weightedaverage unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain whats going on inside the reserve but obviously the actual mechanisms are quite complex the depth in any financial recession the timing of it distribution of outcomes which sectors have hits idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale theres a lot i think on consumer as jamie mentioned it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment so if the labor market remains very strong consumer credit will probably be fine if it doesnt then youre going to see it play through the way it always does', 'hi good morning jeremy on that same topic no change to the full year credit card net chargeoff forecast how do we square that with the rising recession risk is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year or just too early to call', 'we should have not given you that forecast we dont know what the number is going to be thats a', 'i would say thats a shortterm number and based on whats happening today theres a wide range of potential outcomes', 'but mechanically john though as you alluded to there are some mechanical elements to the way card chargeoff works that means that its pretty baked pretty far ahead of time', 'the next couple of quarters yeah', 'so sort of echoing jamies point it just doesnt necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year even if unemployment were to increase significantly it probably wouldnt flow through the chargeoffs until later', 'okay got it and then just on capital how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper or just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it', 'the investment that we do in banks branches technology ai is going to continue regardless of the environment and then we have – depending what happens to basel iii and ccar and gsifi and all that  billion to  billion of excess capital and in the chairmans letter i wrote about what we think of that but based upon the environment the turbulence issues i like having excess capital we are prepared for any environment and thats so we can serve clients thats not for any other reason so we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are', 'thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open', 'good morning just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend theres been headlines in travel kind of going down just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up  yearoveryear', 'yeah its a good question and were seeing that too so let me talk about travel i mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them specifically in airline travel and were seeing that too through the card spend its not obvious to us that thats necessarily an indicator for broader patterns there are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend and as i mentioned previously another thing that we are seeing looking at the april data is what would appear to be a little bit of frontloading of spending specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs so you see people behaving rationally and i have noted even you hear anecdotes and ive seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pretariff inventory and so on and so forth so its not that surprising that youre seeing that a little bit in the spending data the other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like whats happening by income band because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment and i think when we look at our card data and also our cash buffers and peoples checking accounts of course it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment but when you take a step back and you ask are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment the answer is no so sure the margin and cash buffers are lower and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments but actually some of the increases in spending that were seeing in april are actually coming from the lower income segment so no evidence of distress i would say', 'okay thats helpful color and then just separately if we look at the delinquencies for the home lending the increase both quarteronquarter and yearoveryear is that just some of the noise from the first republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially reseason from an accounting point of view or is there something else going on there', 'sorry the – i actually didnt hear which fees', 'delinquencies in home lending', 'i didnt – interesting i havent looked at that well have to get back to you on that', 'i dont think its anything', 'whatever it is it wasnt important enough to get raised so', 'it could be the first republic accounting yes', 'okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research you may proceed', 'hi good morning and thanks for taking my questions wanted to start off with one on the proposed slr changes and just the impact of rate volatility the treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the slr just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the year but given the geopolitical concerns weakening global demand for treasuries how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing us treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how youre managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some the recent volatility', 'yes so slr alone isnt going to change that much for us it may change for other people we really need reform across slr gsifi ccar basel iii and lcr all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change and remember its not relief to the banks its relief to the markets jpmorgan will be fine withwithout an slr change the reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets if they dont – if they do spreads will come in therell be more active traders if they dont the fed will have to intermediate which i think is just a bad policy idea that every time theres a kerfuffle in the markets the fed has to come in and intermediate so they should make these changes the point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries it affects all other capital markets thats the reason to do it not as a favor to the banks themselves and we dont take more interest rate exposure to this in any way shape or form so its not like were going to change our position we intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do and if the banks could take bigger positions they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure i should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter', 'and steve all i would add to that is that it is of course true and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were in fact bound by slr as a result of the expansion of the deposit base and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that so weve seen when it is binding and it works not as designed which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed i think our point is a little bit as jamie said in his chairmans letter that its not the only thing that needs to be fixed and there are interactions among all these things and we as a bank are not particularly bound by it there is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential tlac issuance impact there which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in so that will be an interesting thing to watch', 'thank you both for that perspective and just for my followup did want to ask on the markets outlook so admittedly less surprising to hear some of the cautious ib commentary in light of the uncertainty but was hoping you could just speak to the markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility but also some indications that clients are taking down risk how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters', 'yeah its a good question as you know steve were obviously not going to give markets guidance your guess is as good as ours at some level but the ingredients are the right ingredients i mean weve often discussed about how this business all else equal benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally which they more or less have been of course its not guaranteed we need to do a good job managing the risk and yeah there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk that could be a headwind for us so were going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter', 'thats great thank you both for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets you may proceed', 'thank you hi jeremy and jamie can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the nontraditional lenders private credit lenders theyve been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years particularly since the initial basel iii endgame proposal came out in july of  which is no longer applicable but are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may reintermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility', 'i mean thats hard to tell gerard i think its too early to tell but what i would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what weve been saying about this space for some time which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment whether thats a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche direct lending type structure were open for business for all of it and i would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment part of what were talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles as weve always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment were in so if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment that will be great', 'very good thank you and then as a followup you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers whether its slr or the gsib buffer et cetera can you opine for us your views are you more confident with the new administration the new personnel whether its treasury secretary bessent or others the nominees for different regulatory heads that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration', 'yeah i mean gerard we always say this and its true which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole and that was true before and its true now with this administration as well clearly the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more progrowth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy and as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done so lets see how that plays out but were looking forward to continuing to engage constructively', 'yeah i think theres a deep recognition of the flaws in the system and there should be and fortunately theyre going to take a good look at it', 'very good thank you', 'thanks gerard operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may proceed', 'thank you good morning i guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty i think when you talk to investors weve gone from enthusiasm for a probusiness administration to a lot of headwinds and i think jamie mentioned youll have companies take down guidance et cetera potentially over the coming weeks im just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates or the day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs is that enough or im just wondering when you talk to clients corporate ceos what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe  or  days ago', 'first of all some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration like the geopolitical situation the excess fiscal deficits poorly done regulations and all that obviously progrowth is good probusiness is good prodereg is good i think the best thing to do is to allow the secretary of treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners and i think therell be agreements in principle theyre not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be  or  pages long and thats the best way to go about it right now that does not mean you wont have some of the effects take place anyway', 'got it i guess as a follow up i think theres a lot of concern also in the treasury markets weve seen the year move from  to  in a matter of a week just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market do you see the fed stepping in pausing qt maybe even initiating some treasury purchases just any color would be great', 'yeah but again i mean we have sticky inflation we had that before i personally have told you all i dont think thats going to go away and that relates to that obviously the us dollar still is the reserve currency and that isnt going to change though some people may feel slightly differently about it and the fed – weve been inconsistent there will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations ive told you that consistently it happened in covid it happened before it happened that will happen and then when that happens the fed will step in thats what happens and theyre not going to do it now because you dont have all those issues yet theyll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we dont know if and when thats going to happen and well see but the notion that the year treasury has to go down is a false notion if we look at history in prior times when we have huge global deficits back in the s in the s the guns and butter and tariffs at least our economists think will be inflationary to  or something like that so well have to wait and see and deal with it', 'for most – mostly havent dealt with this stuff before and youre going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months and then well know', 'got it thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global securities you may proceed', 'hey good morning jeremy just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half june to december how do you think about the trajectory of nii this year is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into  just trying to think of that around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year', 'yes its funny jim because i was asked on the press call how come were not like suspending guidance or whatever and my answer was like', 'right', 'well whatever we give guidance and we do our best and its contingent on a variety of external variables and we always make our guidance contingent on that so in that context', 'and the yield curve youre using', 'which we know will not happen', 'yeah and the particular nuance as youll recall from last quarter where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the nii outlook including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that its both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact producing a potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth i think that given everything thats going on on that one probably well wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that certainly the backloaded cuts all else equal from a runrate perspective introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year well just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters', 'right and maybe just to', 'it will not happen that way and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate', 'right and maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits obviously this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to cash tends to drive higher deposits did you see that trend in march and particularly in april what are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation', 'its a little hard to tell to be honest it is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations i dont think i can say with any confidence that thats a result of the environment that were in so i think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that', 'ill just – ill say it may not be deposits it may be treasury bills or various other things and what youve seen which is different its not the risk off trade in the year that is fundamentally different this time', 'right okay thanks for taking my questions', 'jamie youve been through many cycles and i think were all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress and im wondering is there anything that youve seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle youve seen', 'an almost impossible answer we look at all the cycles and you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes were not – i dont personally like predicting what the future is going to hold but i do – ive pointed out over and over theres a lot of issues out there i think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months so maybe when were doing this call next quarter we wont have to be guessing well actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that but its – the result in a bank is almost always the same which is volatile markets credit losses go up people get more conservative investments go down what looks like a recession is it mild or hard i dont know and – but we are – ive been quite cautious and you can see in our capital our liquidity our position our balance sheet and so were prepared but we do all that so we can', 'serve our clients through thick or thin were not guessing about what the future is going to hold obviously if you look at our numbers we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything', 'excellent okay no thank you for that and then', 'but betsy this is different okay this is different this is the global economy and please read my chairmans letter the most important thing to me is the western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy that is the most important thing i really almost dont care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters that isnt that important well get through that weve had recessions before and all that its the ultimate outcome whats the goal how can we get there and its literally that i mean – and the china issue is a major issue i dont know how thats going to turn out we obviously have to follow the law of the land but its a significant change that weve never seen in our lives', 'okay thank you so much for that and yes looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming so then one for jeremy question on the wholesale loans im going into this because i noticed your average loan growth i think it was running at about  yearonyear and then end of period loans was up  and wholesale loans was up  so im just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end and its a broader question on just liquidity do you see your customers looking for more liquidity are they drawing down lines and maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market that would be helpful too thank you', 'yeah its a good question betsy so a couple of things one is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity interestingly i actually asked the question like a day ago whether we were seeing draws meaningfully observable draws from clients and the answer to that question was no at least not yet so i dont know what to make of that but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now yeah so on wholesale loans beyond that i dont think theres that much of a story now were seeing a bit more growth in sort of like markets loans as opposed to traditional ci loans in the current moment but thats neither here nor there did you have – yeah you asked – what did you ask also front end of the yield curve liquidity', 'yes just in', 'was that your question', 'money markets fed funds the front end seemed to suggest', 'hey jamie you just said on this call theres a deep recognition of flaws by the new regulatory regime and can you put – you or jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as whats been an ideal scenario you keep the safety and soundness of the system but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible how much could expenses potentially decline i assume you pass on some of that to customers and youd keep some of that and the regulators would save money so some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation but before that the negative which you highlight in the press release and the chairman letter about trade wars jamie you went from trade wars get over it to this week say do something so just as far as the tariff journey what were you initially expecting to what happened and do you really think next earnings call well be through most of the uncertainty thanks', 'yeah no i dont think well necessarily be through all the uncertainty i think youll just know a lot more and my quote was about get over it i wish i hadnt said it i was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security national security is paramount all things should be subordinated to it you may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security national security is a small part of trade so – and its rare earths penicillin medical ingredients certain types of – obviously youve heard about semiconductors that was my quote about get over it i did not change my view about it i would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals i think theyll be good for everybody and they want to do it too theyve said they want to do it theyve said theyre having conversations with   different people and so i do think if the regulators change regulations it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system and i dont – i wouldnt expect an expense drawdown that youre going to see there will be thousands – hundreds of people maybe but its not going to be passed on but it will reduce netnet the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if its done right i specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my chairmans letter this year about if they do some of these reforms the cost of mortgages would come down  basis points if i were them id be focusing on that right now', 'no and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the cet ratio i guess back down by onefifth', 'if you do all – you have to fix lcr gsifi ccar slr and i think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for jpmorgan annually of various types of lending to the system some would be markets some would be middle market loans et cetera and i pointed out if you wanted to look at the big numbers that loans to deposits are now  for the banking system writ large that used to be  and the reason for that isnt – its not just capital it is also lcr it is also gsifi also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart mike is could you have the same – and i believe you have a safer system lend more money have more liquidity eliminate bank runs eliminate what happened to first republic and silicon valley and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations thats what i would like to see them do i dont know whats going to happen were going to', 'one short', 'you can read our – i think our nprs are public and stuff like that and so they should do that just make a better system or you have the best in the world weve kind of started to cripple it slowly if you dont – id say you look at these rules and regulations see europe if thats where we want to go lets just go there', 'one short followup just first quarter you mentioned good credit good trading good eps beat im not sure anyone cares theyre worried more about the things were talking about here but in terms of the risk of being an international company an international us company during trade wars and i know jpmorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers so how do you think about that risk how should we think about that risk and hopefully your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point', 'yeah i honestly add that to the list of worries we will be in the crosshairs thats whats going to happen and its okay were deeply embedded in these other countries people like us but i do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about american banks and well just have to deal with that', 'all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open', 'hi just one followup on this whole risk managementregulatory front i see i hear and i agree flawed regulatory system could be better weve had massive volatility the market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results so has something changed are the systems better are they better able to handle your risk management your people the diversity of your platform better or are there still environments where not all volatility is good just curious to get your big picture thoughts thanks', 'i mean maybe ill start with that one glenn so i guess i think that your points arent mutually exclusive meaning i mean were always continually improving the franchise weve talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses including markets and so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients so im sure were kind of better at it than we were five years ago as i think probably everyone is at the margin im not sure that you can associate that with the current performance i think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that weve managed very successfully and to your point i think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the markets franchise the answer to that question is definitely yes when you have gappy volatility with no trading volume people paralyzed clients unsure what to do active managers struggling those environments are bad so people make fun of the kind of good volatility bad volatility story but whether we like it or not its real and in the end we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients and as i said earlier were happy to see that', 'jeremy – i agree jeremy i would add to that volatility leads to bigger bidask spreads that all things being equal is better and it leads sometimes to higher volumes so youve seen really high volumes in fx and interest rate swaps a whole bunch of different things treasuries thats better but as jeremy pointed out sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes like you see in dcm today when you dont have these bond deals where you have less trading when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that and how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell but our folks do a great job and were here to help our clients so we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down but the plumbing of the system i would say the plumbing worked well during covid too i mean it wasnt the plumbing that was a problem and wasnt even a problem to go back to some of the real crises weve had so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing make sure it stays true', 'and i do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldnt make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem everything jamies been talking about slr lcr ilst gsib basel iii endgame rwa the whole panoply of items which interacts as weve often talked about and is miss calibrated it will at the margin make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment so that remains quite important as a policy priority', 'thats a great point thanks for that appreciate it', 'thanks glenn operator thank you and our final question will go to the line of saul martinez with hsbc you may proceed', 'okay good morning thanks for taking my question most of my questions have been asked and answered but i guess ill ask about costs since nobody has asked it but i guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts if you do see a revenue slowdown but not necessarily a severe downturn i think you do have in the  billion guidance you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing and i guess do you – does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think thats just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy', 'yeah so youve slightly answered your own question there saul but it is nonetheless a good question so let me unpack it a little bit so the way i think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment so we talk about those as volume and revenuerelated expenses so you will see those come down as a function of the environment its also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases which depending on how the environment changes could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally ie through the lens of their ability to generate longterm shareholder value through a long investment cycle and so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling we would obviously adjust of course the thing that were not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional longterm investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons as you well know thats just not how we run the company this quarter as it happens a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what youre saying about for example the investment banking outlook but its worth noting that investment banking performance this quarter was actually fine as you know markets performance was very strong and there are also some ups and downs in there i should note including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case and while some of that is offset in revenue its a little noisy so thats a factor as well its small but im just highlighting that theres some slightly nonobvious things that are nonstrategic obviously', 'can i just add a management thing that i think is very important and i always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses which i would put in the category of bureaucracy lack of efficiency things you dont need to do and you can – if you go to – if you read my chairmans letter the last section is called management learnings and if you look at companies that over time fail its almost always bureaucracy complacency arrogance and lack of attention to detail and so there is – were making a – i shouldnt say it but im mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after covid – the buildup in headcount the buildup in rules and regulations the people working or not working from home after all of those things we just think theres more efficiency here and i think some of the – and mike mayo mentioned the bit about regulation he is right there will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit i mean we – i pointed out resolutionrecovery which is a complete waste of time is  pages long okay it will never happen that way ccar which is virtually a waste of time is  pages long okay we report  trillion – i think its  trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that there is this excessive cost built up that we – that hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but its not the new branches so', 'and the folks here are working on we call it streamlining jenn piepszak has got a war room going on it we already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that so – and were having fun doing it its like – to me its like exercising and eating your spinach its what we should be doing we havent done it for a while so – and i apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner', 'thank you well talk to you next quarter operator thank you all for participating in todays conference you may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day

please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion and delivered an rotce of  these results included the first republic bargain purchase gain of  billion a credit reserve build for the first republic lending portfolio of  billion as well as  million of net investment securities losses in corporate touching on a few highlights ccb client investment assets were up  yearonyear we had record longterm inflows in awm and we ranked number one in ib fee wallet share before giving you more detail on the financials let me give you a brief update on the status of the first republic integration on page  the settlement process with the fdic is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid first republic employees have formally joined us as of july nd and were pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers and although its still early days as we get the sales force back in the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about  billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition now turning back to this quarters results on page  youll see that in various parts of the presentation we have specifically called out the impact of first republic where relevant to make things easier im going to start by discussing the overall impact of first republic on this quarters results at the firmwide level then for the rest of the presentation i will generally exclude the impact of first republic in order to improve comparability with prior periods with that in mind in this quarter first republic contributed  billion of revenue  million of expense and  billion of net income as noted on the first page this includes  billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in nir in the corporate segment as well as  billion of allowance build and remember that the deal happened on may st so the first republic numbers only represent two months of results youll see in the line of business results that we are showing first republic revenue and allowance in ccb cb and awm and for the purposes of this quarters results all of the deposits are in ccb and substantially all of the expenses are in corporate as the integration continues some of those items will get allocated across the segments now turning back to firmwide results excluding first republic revenue of  billion was up  billion or  yearonyear nii ex markets was up  billion or  driven by higher rates nir ex markets was down  million largely driven by the net investment securities losses i mentioned earlier partially offset by a number of less notable items primarily in the prior year and markets revenue was down  million or  yearonyear expenses of  billion were up  billion or  yearonyear primarily driven by higher compensation expense including wage inflation and higher legal expense and credit costs of  billion included net chargeoffs of  billion predominantly in card the net reserve build included a  million build in the commercial bank a  million build in card and a  million release in corporate all of which i will cover in more detail later on to balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of first republic and as you can see in the two charts on the page weve given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both rwa and cet ratio and as you know we completed ccar a couple of weeks ago our new indicative scb is  versus our current requirement of  and it goes into effect in q the new scb also reflects the boards intention to increase the dividend to  per share in the third quarter on liquidity our bank lcr for the second quarter ended at  in line with what we anticipated at investor day about half of the reduction is associated with the first republic transaction and while were on the balance sheet as we previewed in the k we will be updating our earnings at risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags so when we release this quarters q you will see the up  basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive  billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have been about negative  billion now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  both us consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we havent observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at investor day turning now to the financial results which i will speak to excluding the impact of first republic for ccb cb and awm ccb reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion which was up  yearonyear in banking  wealth management revenue was up  yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates endofperiod deposits were down  quarteronquarter as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers including for seasonal tax payments and seek higheryielding products client investment assets were up  yearonyear driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and digital channels in home lending revenue was down  yearonyear driven by lower nii from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue originations were up quarteronquarter driven by seasonality although still down  yearonyear moving to card services  auto revenue was up  largely driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up  yearonyear which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth and in auto originations were up  billion up  yearonyear as competitors pull back and inventories continue to slowly recover expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by compensation predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing in terms of credit performance this quarter our credit costs were  billion reflecting a reserve build of  million driven by loan growth in card services net chargeoffs were  billion up  million yearon year predominantly driven by card as  dayplus delinquencies have returned to prepandemic levels in line with our expectations next the cib on page  cib reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion investment banking revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear or down  excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year ib fees were down  yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of  in advisory fees were down  underwriting fees were down  for debt and up  for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter in terms of the second half outlook we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets and july should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year however yeartodate announced ma is down significantly which will be a headwind moving to markets total revenue was  billion down  yearonyear fixed income was down  as expected the macro franchise substantially normalized from last years elevated levels of volatility and client flows this was largely offset by improved performance in the securitized products group and credit equity markets was down  against a very strong prioryear quarter particularly in derivatives payments revenue was  billion up  yearonyear excluding equity investments it was up  predominantly driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances securities services revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower fees expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by higher noncompensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth largely offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to the commercial bank on page  commercial banking reported net income of  billion revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins payments revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher rates gross investment banking and markets revenue of  million was down  yearonyear primarily driven by fewer large ma deals expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by higher compensation expense including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense average deposits were up  quarteronquarter driven by inflows related to new client acquisition partially offset by continued attrition in nonoperating deposits loans were up  quarteronquarter ci loans were up  reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing cre loans were also up  reflecting funding on prioryear originations for construction loans in real estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity finally credit costs were  million net chargeoffs were  million including  million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of  million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market as well as net downgrade activity in middle market banking then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by higher compensation including growth in our private banking advisor teams higher revenuerelated compensation and the impact of global shares and jp morgan asset management in china both of which closed within the last year for the quarter record net longterm inflows were  billion positive across all channels regions and asset classes led by fixed income and equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and overall client assets of  trillion were up  yearonyear driven by continued net inflows higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of global shares and finally loans were down  quarteronquarter driven by lower securitiesbased lending and deposits were down  turning to corporate on page  as i noted upfront we are reporting the first republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in corporate excluding those items corporate reported net income of  million revenue was  million up  million compared to last year nii was  billion up  billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates nir was a net loss of  million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront expenses of  million were up  million yearonyear largely driven by higher legal expense and credit costs were a net benefit of  million reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with first republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction next the outlook on page  we now expect  nii and nii ex markets to be approximately  billion with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale and i should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we do expect the nii run rate to be substantially below this quarters run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out our expense outlook for  remains approximately  billion and on credit we continue to expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be approximately  so to wrap up we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter as we look forward we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the basel iii rules nonetheless despite the likely headwinds ahead we remain optimistic about the companys ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios', 'thanks good morning hey jeremy you talked about nii guidance up clearly fed funds futures are up so it makes some sense but maybe i guess first could you kind of discuss – i guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what youre seeing there so far it seems to be coming in a little better than expected and then secondly and probably more importantly can you help us think about the implications of higherforlonger rates on the outlook for nii next year and beyond i guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about', 'yeah sure thanks jim so yeah so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision as i said its higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice hard to untangle the two drivers and specifically i think when you look at consumer the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback were getting from the field and the cd offerings in particular has meant that its quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective and similarly in wholesale were just seeing slower internal migrations you asked about mix i think that obviously were seeing the cd mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion but as you say the most important point is the fact that as i said earlier we dont consider this level of nii generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about a sort of mediumterm run rate in the mids that was before first republic and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher but whatever it is its a lot lower than the current number we dont know when thats going to happen were not going to predict the exact moment thats going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point', 'okay but i guess just one followup on that just if we dont get rate cuts till middle of next year or later does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice', 'i wouldnt necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mids number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular when we put that number out there we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that it was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a throughthecycle sustainable number so i wouldnt think of it as being particularly ratedependent', 'okay great thanks operator next well go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed', 'hi good morning jeremy im just laughing to myself because i said to you at investor day – do you have any more nii rabbits to pull out of the hat and i guess you do so i guess i want to ask a broader question really here and maybe jamie id like to get your thoughts so you earned  rotce on  cet and we hear you loud and clear that youre more normalized nii generation is not  billion that being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from basel iii endgame is it possible that your natural rotce is maybe above that  throughthecycle rate when rates arent zero because when you first introduced that rotce target we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybodys talking about even if the fed cuts the natural sort of bottom in fed funds is not going to be zero so any input on that would be great', 'yeah thanks erika i mean its a good question theres a lot in there obviously i guess i would start by saying that when we talked about the  throughthecycle rotce even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment and at some level that remains true today furthermore you didnt ask this explicitly but in the context of the proposed basel iii endgame one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator what happens to that target so i think as i said in my prepared remarks we feel very confident about the companys ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle theres a lot of moving parts right now in that some of them could be good some of them could be bad narrowly on the capital one the one thing to point out is that the straightup math of simply diluting down the rotce by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice repricing of products and services which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy so were not suggesting that we can price our way out of it but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital so a lot of moving parts in there but i think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results and well see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the basel iii proposal and then go through the comment period', 'and erika i would just add one thing we do have a mix of businesses that earn from like  rotce to  we have some which are very capitalintensive so we look at kind of all of them and i think  is a good number and a good target the other thing were overearning on is credit weve been overearning on credit for a substantial amount of time now were quite conscious about it we know that its going to pick up just as it normalizes considerably more than now look we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to ', 'and so my followup question there maybe jeremy could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your acl ratio as of the second quarter', 'thank you operator next well go to the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research you may proceed', 'hi good morning jeremy wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the barr speech we dont have the details yet but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on rwa and potentially on the gsib front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently', 'yeah thanks john so obviously were thinking about that a lot on the other hand as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning it does seem like this time its real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something so soon enough well get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork having said that indulging in a little bit of guesswork it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including chair powells  number or vice chair barrs  of rwa which winds up being roughly the same is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar and that is a little bit of a straightup acrosstheboard tax on everything its kind of hard to optimize your way out of that with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price assuming you have pricing power but thats obviously not what we want and thats what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy so there are details there is a lot of the frtb stuff we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing but this time around it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way', 'okay thats helpful and with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the rotce comes down a bit how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years', 'yeah i mean i guess im sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here i mean were not going to sacrifice investments right that wont come as a surprise to you generally speaking were always going to try to comply with new requirements early so when we know the requirements and when we have visibility obviously given how much organic capital were generating right now whatever the answer winds up being itll be pretty easy to comply narrowly speaking but thats not the same as saying that there wont be consequences to returns or to pricing and if for whatever reason things arent exactly as were anticipating i dont see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever', 'okay and theres some room for buybacks', 'its unlikely obviously that would be an unlikely outcome', 'sorry john go ahead did you have a followup', 'yeah no just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically do you episodically buy back', 'i mean capital hierarchy again right in the end when we have nothing else to do with the money well do buybacks and we talked about the  billion for this year obviously a lot of new moving parts there although all else equal given what weve done so far thats still probably a reasonable number for the full year but yeah thats always going to be at the end of the list but yeah', 'got it okay thank you operator next well go to the line of ken usdin from jefferies you may proceed', 'thanks good morning i just wanted to ask a little bit about how youre feeling about the tradeoff between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the investment banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like reopening of markets and the tradeoff between getting some more of those fees in versus whats happening on the loan demand side thanks', 'sure good question ken so i think in terms of investment banking and markets yeah slightly better than expected last month what i would talk about green shoots especially in capital markets generally still definitely some headwinds in ma lower announced activity some regulatory headwinds there so well see i think its a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results but well see in terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations generally we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth but away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products whether it be mortgage or ci after revolver normalization and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy i would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there so were not really expecting meaningful growth away from card but of course were there for the right deals right products right terms we lend through the cycle so i see that as more of a demanddriven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side', 'that makes sense and as a followup to that on the consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer and is that card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits just kind of want the tradeoff on that side too', 'yeah i mean to us i think we still see this as a normalization not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit actually revolve per account has still not gotten to prepandemic levels actually so i would definitely say that its a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point and yeah i think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here', 'got it okay thank you operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead', 'good morning jeremy good morning jamie jeremy can you give us your view on how youre measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe were approaching the terminal rate on fed funds rates', 'yeah gerard i would say honestly not much changed there actually we have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates of course we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios but at the margin weve been biased towards higher rates and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling but in any case all else equal i think we are going to continue to focus on making sure were fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios so not really a lot of change in our positioning and thats obviously including the fact that we took on first republic which even net of some of the liabilities had a long structural interest rate position we did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal and so as a result we took actions to ensure that netnet we are still about the same as we were last quarter', 'very good and then as a followup you mentioned in giving us the readthrough on the commercial banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the middle market area can you go a little deeper what are you guys seeing in this area both commercial real estate but also the ci loans whats happening in that segment as well', 'yeah so i would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this i mean i think that when we talk about office for example our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of socalled urban dense office is even smaller the vast majority of our overall portfolio is multifamily lending so as a result like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small but you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio in the middle market segment we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades but i dont see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader readacross', 'thank you operator next well go to the line of steve chubak from wolfe research please go ahead', 'steve you there operator it looks like his line dropped so next well go to the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america you may proceed', 'good morning i guess just first question following up on the outlook for the economy like weve all been worried about the recession for a year and theres a debate about the lagged effects of the fed rate hike cycle when you think about – jeremy i think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle  to  months from now or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe us businesses consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago', 'yeah so i mean im sure jamie has some views here but in my view i would just caution against jumping to too many superpositive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints and i think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we dont get too much euphoria that overconcentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that theres a range of outcomes out there so obviously people are talking a lot about the potential for softlanding right now no landing immaculate disinflation or whatever and whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully i dont know but the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on jamies prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even postpandemic so were probably overearning on credit a little bit obviously weve talked about the expectation that the nii is going to come down quite a bit so even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization', 'yeah and i would just add that the  is not our prediction that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for cecl so you have this prediction thats going to always look something different and we dont know the outcome we try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape theyre spending down their excess cash – thats all tailwinds even if we go to a recession theyre going with rather good conditions low borrowings and good house price values still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented theres war in ukraine oil and gas quantitative tightening unprecedented fiscal needs of governments qt which we never experienced before i just think people should take a deep breath on that we dont know if those things could put us in a soft landing a mild recession or a hard recession and obviously we all hope for the best', 'got it and just a followup on the upcoming basel reforms two questions youve talked about the impact to the us economy like others have said the same at this point is that falling on deaf ears and secondly maybe jeremy if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the capital markets business because of frtb thank you', 'yeah so on your first point i mean i think you can just read vice chair barrs speech right', 'he addressed that point fairly directly he clearly doesnt agree as is his right so well see what happens we continue to feel that all else equal higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit which is bad for the economy so well see what happens on that on frtb its really very nuanced its probably too much detail for this call to be honest but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example one product under frtb is yield curve spread options and if the frtb proposal goes through as currently written that product just becomes not viable so obviously if we need to stop doing that product no one really cares but its just one example of the way sometimes when youre really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly you can wind up having to change your business mix there are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layeringon of the operational risk and the way its being proposed especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal dont come through youre once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners so well see well see what happens', 'i would just add to that even if your product doesnt make money you might do it for clients who are great clients youre going to manage by product by client and by effectively business mix and those need adjustments roughly loans dont make sense to put on your balance sheet as a whole almost any loan and people have to recognize that and so we just manage through all the various complications here and figure out what the hell to do', 'okay thank you operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hi i had another question on vice chair barrs speech from this week to the extent that capital ratios do go up  for you and perhaps others to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do its kind of ironic or maybe its not ironic that apollo hits an alltime stock price high at the same week of the speech so how much business leaves jpmorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed', 'wait before jeremy answers the question this is great news for hedge funds private equity private credit apollo blackstone – and theyre dancing in the streets', 'yeah exactly and i was going to say mike yes to everything so meaning repricing yes definitely to the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that were not generating the right returns for shareholders we will try to reprice and well see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products and if the repricing is not successful then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services and as jamie points out that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere and thats fine as jamie points out those people are clients and i think that point was addressed also in vice chair barrs speech but traditionally having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences so these are all important things to consider', 'alright and separate question i appreciate the investor day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out we are still all watching that closely having said that you just increased revenue guidance by  billion for nii between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even  arent you tempted to spend a little bit more why not spend more if youre gaining share and im not saying that you should im just wondering like arent you tempted to do so you have  billion more revenues and youre not spending  more of expenses like why not', 'mike let me get this right youre actually complaining that our expenses arent high enough is that right', 'wait wait just to be clear its just the flip side of the question i asked for two years going back to it', 'fair enough i appreciate the balance in all seriousness weve always been pretty clear right that our spending is throughthecycle spending based on throughthecycle investment throughthecycle spending based on our throughthecycle view of the earningsgenerating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns so broadly speaking nii tends to flow straight through to the bottom line both when its going up and by the way when its going down too and weve been through those moments as you well remember so whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that we have actually looked at that recently i dont see that being a meaningful item this year which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far but this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them dont', 'and then last quick followup', 'mike i think were kind of running as fast as we can so if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance auto market bankers recruiters traders – mike this is it were full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful so its not just the money its the people and how many things you can change all at once and add to all at once', 'and then one quick followup to that your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest weve seen in a long long time and i guess youre saying dont extrapolate this efficiency ratio because nii will come down at some point but when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the lowcost providers where do you think youre there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter youre getting closer', 'yeah i mean you said it yourself right you definitely can extrapolate the current numbers but i think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to lowcost providers it sort of speaks to an area that youve been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that were doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – thats a big part of the reason that were doing the investments that were doing and modernization and cloud and ai and all the type of stuff that weve talked about a lot so i think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company but there definitely is room for improvement', 'alright thank you operator next well go to the line of steven chubak from wolfe research you may proceed', 'hey thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of rrp versus industry deposits just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half both for you and even the broader industry especially as treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest', 'yeah good question steve so let me say a couple things about this so obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the first republic transaction but now if you look at our kind of endofperiod deposits this quarter and you project forward our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of qt playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share just to give a couple examples like in consumer weve got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there and in wholesale weve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates and so there are potentially some share offsets there but broadly our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise within that you note the same thing weve noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the tga build has come into effect and youve seen a lot of bill issuance big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of rrp and so far with most of the tga build – i guess theyre targeting  billion and theyre at  billion – or something so theyre almost done more of it than some people feared has come out of rrp so as you say i think thats a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when youve got ample supply of shortdated collateral on the front end of the yield curve so that whole rrptga bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant but it is good to see rrp coming down a little bit', 'helpful color and just a followup on card income revenues were muted in the quarter i was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure maybe more specifically how much of a drag is associated with fas  versus some other factors', 'yeah so actually that card income number steve is a little bit of a oneoff thing so we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter kind of a technical thing so thats just a temporary headwind and also the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive oneoff item in the prior period and obviously i know you guys looked at it but card income isnt sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves', 'can you size the reward liability impact', 'why dont you get mikael to give that to you its not that significant but its enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky', 'great thanks for taking my questions operator next well go to the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed', 'thank you just want to followup on this pricing power conversation because youve been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape but i guess my question is if not now when meaning a lot has changed on the institutional side the european bank side the regional bank side and i would think that thered be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on and then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the realworld consequences for markets and end users that youre referring to when talking about material regulatory changes thanks a lot', 'sure so look on pricing power youre right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks and so its very granular its very productspecific and in some cases well have more pricing power than in other cases i think the overall point that were trying to make in connection with basel iii endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can that is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen importantly since we dont actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details and sorry glenn i forgot the second half of your question what was it', 'actually i think you hit on it so ill just do a followup on a related so the notion of private credit doing large traditional investmentgrade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price in jamies letter you talked about the downside – or my question is whats the downside if more of the mortgage credit assetbacked intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system', 'i mean i guess it depends on what you mean by downside but i just think societally speaking i think weve seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad when you have economic downturns it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole and jamie has written about this extensively beyond that financially weve talked about how mortgage lending – i mean the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable then it was less so like the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit but its a thinmargin business its challenging and when you increase the capital requirements it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where youre in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago and it might in fact mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter', 'appreciate that jeremy operator next well go to the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed', 'i just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined thats coming in the q jeremy regarding the asset sensitivity going from liabilitysensitive to assetsensitive at least thats the way i read it i just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is', 'yeah sure no problem betsy i mean as you know thats always been a challenging number its meant as a risk management measure of sorts although its also somewhat limited in that respect and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our nii trajectory when rates change but as weve looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle weve come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags and so weve done that and that just has the effect that i talked about – it increases the ear number about  billion from minus  billion which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it wouldve been this quarter without the change to something more like  billion', 'so then…', 'all the usual caveats apply right i mean its never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates the change in our nii is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows but we do our best to make it easy', 'okay and so is it fair for me to think about that change as a marktomarket to where we are today and when i think about your forward guide here longerterm youre saying look deposit betas are accelerating so as i go through the qs over the next four five quarters i should expect that that  billion should come down because deposit betas youre anticipating are going to be accelerating from here im just trying to put those two things together', 'yeah its a good question its quite a technical issue so i think in the past the way this number was constructed was to assume throughthe cycle betas on all the deposits and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it wouldve been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a  shock to the forward curve the nuance that weve introduced now is to recognize that given the shock the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that but i think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next  months relative to our nii guide might be a bridge too far im not sure you can actually draw that conclusion', 'right but you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here and thats part of the outlook for nii longerterm to normalize in the mids is that right', 'yes but let me emphasize something on that go ahead jamie', 'yeah i mean basically yes if you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be  to  to  bps i mean whatever the product is yeah thats the lag and the  billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up if rates dont actually go up that  billion may be exactly  billion again', 'got it', 'yeah exactly and what i was going to say betsy is just that the projection of the  billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential which is by no means guaranteed of productlevel reprice and furthermore then obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate wholesale to consumer', 'yeah operator next well go to the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank you may proceed', 'good morning so im in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here but i guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully so the top two banks have about  consumer market share loantodeposit ratios are low your outlook for loan growth and i think others is fairly sluggish at least outside of card i get that its common sense and thats what weve seen historically but there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just dont need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons so what would make you change that', 'yeah in the end matt its just feedback from the field its competition and feedback from the field we – jamie go ahead', 'i think every bank is in a different position about what they need and so you have a whole range of outcomes but remember we do this also by city so you have different competition in arizona – in phoenix – than you have in chicago illinois and when you do have high interest rate products so its a combination of all those things i wouldnt call it big bank versus small bank and youre going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didnt and things like that so look guys i would take it as a given i think its a mistake there is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up take it as a given there is no circumstance that weve ever seen in the history of banking where rates didnt get to a certain point that you had to have competing products and rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to cds or money market funds were going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts', 'yeah matt its really just about primary bank relationships in the end thats the core of the strategy', 'yeah i mean again i  agree but weve never seen kind of loanstodeposit ratios for banks like yours this low so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up i mean ive seen the tradeoff that eventually youll', 'but thats a little more complicated because a lot of that loantovalue ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff lcr capital ratio etcetera', 'got it okay all right thank you', 'thanks operator and for our final question well go to charles peabody from portales partners you may proceed', 'morning jeremy on page  of your presentation you show some liquidity metrics and theres been a meaningful deterioration or i shouldnt say deterioration depletion of some of that excess liquidity obviously for first republic primarily so my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as i look out towards  theres probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity so thats my first question whats your plans for replenishing that liquidity', 'yeah charlie so i know we talked about this a little bit at investor day right so as i said in my prepared remarks yeah we think about half of the change in the bank lcr number is a consequence of first republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in systemwide deposits flowing through into our hqla balances and the bank lcr ratio so thats all entirely as expected and therefore i think that the replenishing notion is not correct in fact obviously we still have ample ample liquidity now if you want to project trends forward thats a different story but thats sort of the business of banking well adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us', 'and i would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release  trillion of cash and marketable securities even if we get down to no excess were going to have like i forgot the exact number  trillion i think we have excess liquidity and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different i think theres plenty of liquidity in the system and of course we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to', 'all right so sort of wrapped into that as a followup if you take your  billion forecast for nii this year and that implies at least one quarter of maybe  billion of nii and you take your eventual forecast of mid billion of nii at some point in the future that would imply at least one quarter of  billion of nii so thats about an  drop and if you hold the balance sheet steady youre talking about a basis point drop in your margin your nim to get from  billion to  billion i mean what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity im just trying to get a better sense of the impact is', 'yeah hey charlie i would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story its just not that complicated right i think we did this – i think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page just very simple terms that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of nii run rate so whether its as a consequence of migration from loweryielding to higheryielding going from  to a  cd is obviously a big impact on margin or whether its because savings reprices relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when youve got a couple trillion dollars of deposits so its really not any more complicated than that and thats why were being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be', 'thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase  co thank you very much jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorgan chase  co thank you guys operator

undertake to update any forwardlooking statements', 'thank you and good morning everyone starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion with an rotce of  these results included the  billion net gain related to visa shares and the  billion foundation contribution of the appreciated visa stock also included is  million of net investment securities losses in corporate excluding these items the firm had net income of  billion eps of  and an rotce of  touching on a couple of highlights in the cib ib fees were up  yearonyear and  quarteronquarter and markets revenue was up  yearonyear in ccb we had a record number of firsttime investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and weve continued to see strong net inflows across awm now before i give more detail on the results i just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the first republic contribution in the presentation going forward well only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the yearonyear comparison as a reminder we acquired first republic in may of last year so the prioryear quarter only has two months of first republic results compared to the full three months this quarter also in the prioryear quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line of business now turning to page  for the firmwide results the firm reported revenue of  billion up  billion or  yearonyear excluding both the visa gain that i mentioned earlier as well as last years first republic bargain purchase gain of  billion revenue of  billion was up  billion or  nii ex markets was up  million or  driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates higher revolving balances in card and the additional month of first republicrelated nii partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances nir ex markets was up  billion or  excluding the items i just mentioned it was up  billion or  largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees both periods included net investment securities losses and markets revenue was up  million or  yearonyear expenses of  billion were up  billion or  yearonyear excluding the foundation contribution i previously mentioned expenses were up  primarily driven by compensation including revenuerelated compensation and growth in employees and credit costs were  billion reflecting net chargeoffs of  billion and a net reserve build of  million net chargeoffs were up  million yearonyear predominantly driven by card the net reserve build included  million in consumer and  million in wholesale on to balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  up  basis points versus the prior quarter primarily driven by net income largely offset by capital distributions and higher rwa as you know we completed ccar a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points let me summarize them again here our preliminary scb is  although the final scb could be higher the preliminary scb which is up from the current requirement of  results in a  standardized cet ratio requirement which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of  and finally the firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from  to  per share in the third quarter of  now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  ccb reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion which was up  yearonyear in banking  wealth management revenue was down  yearonyear reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue average deposits were down  yearonyear and  quarteron quarter client investment assets were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by market performance in home lending revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear predominantly driven by higher nii including one additional month of the first republic portfolio turning to card services  auto revenue was up  yearonyear predominantly driven by higher card nii on higher revolving balances card outstandings were up  due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were  billion down  coming off strong originations from a year ago while continuing to maintain healthy margins expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by first republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business as i mentioned earlier as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were  billion reflecting net chargeoffs of  billion up  million yearonyear predominantly driven by card as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues the net reserve build was  million also driven by card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables next the commercial  investment bank on page  our new commercial  investment bank reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion youll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the banking  payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise this quarter ib fees were up  yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of  in advisory fees were up  primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prioryear quarter underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up  and debt up  benefiting from favorable market conditions in terms of the outlook were pleased with both the yearonyear and sequential improvement in the quarter we remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline although many of the same headwinds are still in effect its also worth noting that pullforward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year payments revenue was  billion down  yearonyear as deposit margin compression and higher depositrelated client credits were largely offset by fee growth moving to markets total revenue was  billion up  yearonyear fixed income was up  with continued strength in securitized products and equity markets was up  with equity derivatives up on improved client activity and we saw record revenue in prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels security services revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher volumes and market levels largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by higher revenuerelated compensation legal expense and volumerelated noncompensation expense in banking  payments average loans were up  yearonyear due to the impact of the first republic acquisition and flat sequentially demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment and revolver utilization continues to be below prepandemic levels also capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients in cre higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity average client deposits were up  yearonyear and relatively flat sequentially finally credit costs were  million the net reserve build of  million was primarily driven by incorporating the first republic portfolio in the firms modeled approach net chargeoffs were  million of which about half was in office then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher brokerage activity largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation primarily revenuerelated compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams for the quarter longterm net inflows were  billion led by equities and fixed income and in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and client assets of  trillion were up  yearonyear driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows and finally loans and deposits were both flat quarteronquarter turning to corporate on page  corporate reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion excluding this quarters visarelated gain and the first republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year nir was up approximately  million yearonyear nii was up  million yearonyear driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates expenses of  billion were up  million yearonyear excluding foundation contribution expenses were down  million yearonyear largely as a result of moving first republicrelated expense out of corporate into the relevant segments to finish up we have the outlook on page  our  guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at investor day we continue to expect nii and nii ex markets of approximately  billion adjusted expense of about  billion and on credit card net chargeoff rate of approximately  so to wrap up the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income or more importantly after excluding the significant items the underlying performance continues to be quite strong and as always we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline', 'so wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the fed is considering favorable revisions to both basel iii endgame and the gsib surcharge calculations which i know youve been pushing for some time as you evaluate just different capital scenarios are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized rotce at the firm versus the  target and if so just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward', 'right okay thanks steve and actually before answering the question i just want to remind everyone that jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas so its just going to be me today okay good question on the capital and the rotce so let me start with the rotce point first in short my answer to that question would be no its hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on rotce if you think about the way weve been talking about this weve said that before the basel iii endgame proposal we had a  through the cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator and while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing all of which are still sort of in effect most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually like increase the rotce and i dont really think that answer has particularly changed so as of now thats what i would say which is a good pivot to the next point which is yeah weve been reading the same press coverage youve been reading and its fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here but in reality we dont know anything you dont know we dont know how reliable the press coverage is and so in that sense i feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory not much has actually changed relative to what i laid out at investor day the comments that i made then the comments that jamie made then as well as the comments that jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference so maybe ill just briefly summarize for everyones benefit what we think that is which is one we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an everexpanding cet ratio but obviously were going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable cet ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement so after all the uncertainty is sorted out the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when not if on the capital hierarchy its also worth noting thats another thing that remains unchanged so ill review it quickly growing the business organically and inorganically sustainable dividend and in that context its worth noting that the boards announced intention to increase it to  is a  increase prior to last year so thats a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital and then finally buybacks but that hierarchy does not commit us to return  of the capital generation in any given quarter and so as we sit here today when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm its kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience so given all that putting it all together and sorry for the long answer we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital and as jamie has said we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else', 'no need to apologize jeremy that was a really helpful perspective maybe just for my followup on nii youve been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to nii overearning especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds in the second quarter we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth so just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating do you see the potential for nii normalizing higher and where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization', 'yeah interesting question steve so lets talk about deposit balances so yeah i see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating when you look at the system as a whole just to go through it qt is still a bit of a headwind loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that and our pe seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system but on balance net across all those various effects we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances so when we think of our balance outlook we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those systemwide headwinds so in terms of normalizing higher i guess it depends on relative to what but i think its definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative clearly the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year which implied a lot more sequential decline is just the change in the fed outlook so two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there but obviously based on the latest inflation data and so on you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve so well see how it goes and in the end were kind of focused on on just running the place recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning whatever it is', 'understood jeremy thanks so much for taking my questions', 'hi good morning thanks for taking my question jeremy can you give an update on the stress capital buffer you noted obviously that you think there is an error in the feds calculation due to oci can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the fed looks like is there a process to modify the scb higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like', 'yeah so im not going to comment about any conversations with the fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist that stuff is private and so then if you talk about like the timing here right so you know that the stress capital buffer thats been released at  is a preliminary number by rule the fed has to release that by august  it may come sooner you talked about an error in the calculation we havent used that word what we know what we believe rather is that the amount of oci gain that came through the feds disclosed results looked non intuitively high to us and if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer whether the fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them and well see what happens i think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro formad scb whatever it might suitably be you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the yearonyear change in the stress capital buffer for many firms and just sort of reiterating and another example of what weve said a lot over the years that its volatile its untransparent it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank it leads to excessively high management buffers and we think its really not a great way to do things so ill leave it at that', 'okay got it thats helpful just following up on capital returns on steves question i think you highlighted in response its a matter of when not if and obviously jamies not there you cant speak for jamie but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations can you just give us a sense of how youre thinking about the various options any updated thoughts on a special dividend and can you do other things like for example have a material increase in your dividend payout sort of a step function increase where keep that flat and grow into that grow your earnings into that over time can you just maybe give us a sense of how youre thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital', 'sure yeah i mean i would direct you to read im sure you have jamies comments at the industry conference where he participated the week after investor day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points and i think this comment there about the special dividend was that its not really our preference we hear from people that many of our investors wouldnt find that particularly appealing and he said as much that it wouldnt be sort of our first choice so i think the larger point is just that a little bit to your question there are a number of tools in the toolkit and theyre really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy so first and foremost were looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth and then the dividend i think were always going to want to keep it in that sort of like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that and then at the end of it its buybacks and jamies been on the record for over a decade i think over many shareholder letters talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor so thats sort of the totality of the set of options i guess', 'thanks a lot good morning jeremy jeremy great to see the progress on investment banking fees up sequentially and  yearoveryear and i saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didnt see the debt pullforward play through because your dcm was great again im just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead thanks', 'yeah thanks ken its progress right i mean were happy to see the progress people have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and its nice to see not only the yearonyear pop from a low base but also a nice sequential improvement so thats the first thing to say in terms of dialog and engagement its definitely elevated so the dialog on ecm is elevated and the dialog on ma is quite robust as well so all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space but there are some important caveats so on the dcm side yeah we made pullforward comments in the first quarter but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pullforward and therefore were reasonably cautious about the second half of the year importantly a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example acquisition finance so the fact that ma remains still relatively muted in terms of', 'actual deals has knockon effects on dcm as well and when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied then the pullforward risk becomes a little bit higher on ecm if you look at it kind of at a remove you might ask the question given the performance of the overall indices you would think it would be a really booming environment for ipos for example and while its improving its not quite as good as you would otherwise expect and thats driven by a variety of factors including the fact that as has been widely discussed the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by like a few stocks the sort of midcap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving ipos have had much more muted performance also a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations and so in some cases people looking at ipos could be looking at downrounds thats an issue and while secondary market performance of ipos has improved meaningfully in some cases people still have concerns about that so those are a little bit of overhang on that space i think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust and yeah on the advisory side the regulatory overhang is there remains there and so well just have to see how that plays out', 'great thank you for all that jeremy and just one on the consumer side just anything youre noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side obviously your loss rates are coming in as you expected and we did see  days pretty flat and  days come down a little bit is that seasonal is it just a good rate of change trend any thoughts there thanks', 'yeah i still feel like when it comes to card chargeoffs and delinquencies theres just not much to see there its still – its normalization not deterioration its in line with expectations as i say we always look quite closely inside the cohort inside the income cohorts and when you look in there specifically for example on spend patterns you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior thats consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into nondiscretionary but the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that were seeing which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions say like theyve been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever you are seeing slightly higher unemployment you are seeing moderating gdp growth and so its not entirely surprising that youre seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend so it all kind of hangs together in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story', 'thanks ken operator next well go to the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi please go ahead', 'hi thanks very much so jeremy the discussions so far around private credit and you all your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front and i do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component so im curious if youre showing more progress and activity on that front and then very importantly do you see the same trend happening on the assetbacked finance side because thats a bigger part of the world and its a bigger part of your business so id appreciate your thoughts there thanks', 'yeah thanks glenn so on private credit so nothing really new to say there i think i guess one way the environments evolving a little bit is as you know a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals and sort of a little bit to my prior comment in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment at this point youve got a lot of money chasing like not that many deals so the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases which is sort of supportive of the theme that weve been talking about about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space which is kind of our core thesis here which is that we can offer bestinclass service across the entire continuum including secondary market trading and so on so we feel optimistic about our offering there i think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was so its maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether were doing a lot more or less in the space so to speak and then on assetbacked financing you actually asked me that question before and at the time my answer was that i hadnt heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case but clearly there must be something im missing so i can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it', 'no thats great for you if youre not hearing much about it so we can leave it at that maybe just one quick followup in terms of your just overall posturing you were patient and smart when rates were low waited to deploy worked out great we know that story now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and youre being patient and rates are high and im curious on how you think about what kind of triggers what kind of things youre looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration', 'right i mean on duration in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters so thats one thing to say that was more last quarter than this quarter but i guess i would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front so clearly its true that empirically we behaved like very assetsensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess nii generation sort of on the way up in the near term but when we look at the firms overall sensitivity to rates we look at it through both like the eartype lens a shortterm nii sensitivity but also a variety of other lenses including various types of scenario analysis including impacts on capital and higher rates and as i think jamie has said a couple times we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front also given like the inverted yield curve its not as if extending duration from these levels means that youre locking in  rates in fact the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on so i think when you put that all together i dont think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing thats front of line for us', 'super helpful thanks so much for that jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase  co thanks glenn', 'operator next well go to the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead', 'good morning i was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the rotce being too high at  and more normalized at  obviously youve pointed to overearning on nii and i guess the question is is that all of it to go from  to  and if so is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us', 'sure good question matt i mean i guess the way i think about it is a couple of things like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal right so if you kind of build yourself out a fullyear forecast and make reasonable just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter like better look at this on a fullyear basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items and so if you do that like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number thats higher than the  so yeah one source of headwinds is normalization of the nii primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs thats – weve talked about that part of it is also the yield curve effects some cuts will come into the curve at some point and in the normal course if you kind of do a very very very simple mental model of the company you would have like revenues growing at some organic gdp like rate maybe higher and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio but even if the amount of nii normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen so as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there inflation is still nonzero there are still investments that were executing theres still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part the normalization of nii and then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on basel iii endgame and all the other pieces you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator at least based on what we know so far so of course any of those pieces could be wrong but thats kind of how we get to our  and if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my investor day presentation it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors', 'yeah that was a really helpful chart just the one followup on the yield curve effects i guess what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted maybe youre still breathing in the impact of that but kind of longer term youd expect little bit of steepness of the curve which i would think would help but what did you mean by that thank you', 'yeah i mean you and i have talked about this before i guess i sort of – i guess i dont really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond whats priced in by the forewords is a source of structural nii or nim for banks if you know what i mean like i mean people have different views about the socalled term premium and obviously in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics peoples thinking on that may be changing but i think we saw when rates were at zero and the year note was below  everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra nim extra nii by extending duration a lot but when the steepness of the curve implies it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive fed tightening its just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives so therere some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium so to speak could be a source of nii but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you for the details', '', 'thanks matt operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead', 'hi jeremy you said its too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower nii and dcm pullforward and credit costs going higher anything im missing in that list and what would cause you to end the overearning narrative', 'no actually i think that is the right list mike i mean frankly i think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to  i mean to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that were currently producing more than that thats one very simple way to look at that but the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin our deposit margins are well above historical norms and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative', 'your  through the cycle rotce expectation what is the cet ratio that you assume for that', 'i mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer which depending on the shape of rules could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules which goes back to my prior comments on scb and ccar but obviously as you well know what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the rwa lands and obviously things like gsib recalibration and so on so weve done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what i did at investor day that informs those numbers but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that  which is why at investor day when we talked about it both daniel and i were quite specific about saying that we thought  was still achievable assuming a reasonable outcome on the basel iii endgame', 'let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target i mean when i asked jamie at the  investor day would it make sense to have  capital he was basically telling me to take a hike right and now you have  capital and youre saying well we might want to have a lot more capital here i mean at some point if youre spending  billion a year to improve the company if youre gaining share with digital banking if youre automating the back office if youre moving ahead with ai if youre doing all these things that i think you say others arent doing why wouldnt those returns go higher over time or do you just assume youll be competing those benefits away thanks', 'yeah i mean i think in short mike and weve talked about this a lot and jamies talked about this a lot its a very very very competitive market and were very happy with our performance were very happy with the share weve taken and  is like an amazing number actually and like to be able to do that given how robust the competition is from banks from nonbanks from us banks from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in is something that were really proud of so the number has a range around it obviously so its not a promise its not a guarantee and it can fluctuate but were very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that', 'we can deliver it again assuming a reasonable outcome on basel iii endgame but its a very very very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments', 'all right thank you operator next well go to the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead', 'so i did want to ask one drilldown question on q and its related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do i think in the press release right in the slide deck its  billion common stock net repurchases so the question here is whats the governor for you on how much to do every quarter and i mean i understand its a function of okay how much do we organically grow but even with that so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement there but you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time and i remember over at investor day the whole debate around i dont want to buy back my stock but we are right so i get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here', 'yeah thats a very good and fair question betsy so let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability so in no particular order one thing that weve really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings including in our recent qs actually is that we dont want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks so were going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time so i recognize that not everyone loves that but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so i might as well say it explicitly it was pretty clear in the q also but im just going to say that again so thats point one but having said that let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors so generally speaking we think it doesnt make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now lets say obviously when for whatever reason if we ever need to build capital in a hurry weve done it before and were always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely but i think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when youre generating your kind of capital and so we were talking before about this  billion pace were kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace but thats where that idea comes from lets put it that way you talked about the  billion which i recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number but where that actually comes from is the other statement that weve made that we have these significant item gains from visa and if you think about what that means it means that we have post the acceptance of the exchange offer a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock ie visa which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock and so in some sense why carry that instead of just buying back jpmorgan stock so we talked about – jamie talked about as we liquidate the visa deploying those proceeds into jpm and thats what we did this quarter so that is why the  billion is a little higher and its consistent with my comments at investor day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks', 'and beyond that what youre left with is my answer to steves question which is that to your point about buying back earnings or whatever when were generating these types of earnings and theres this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend if we dont return the capital we are going to keep growing the cet ratio to levels which if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company are not reasonable theyre just artificially high and unnecessary so one way or the other that will need to be addressed at some point its just that we dont feel that now is the right time', 'all right thank you jeremy appreciate it', 'thanks betsy operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead', 'hi jeremy how are you', 'jeremy i know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question i noticed on the average balances the noninterest bearing deposits were relatively stable quartertoquarter versus prior quarters when theyve steadily declined and this is one of the areas of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers can you elaborate if you can what youre seeing in that noninterestbearing deposit account i know this is average and not period and the end number may actually be lower but what are you guys seeing here', 'yeah good question gerard i have to be honest i hadnt focused on that particular sequential explain ie quarteronquarter change and average noninterestbearing deposits but i think the more important question is the big picture question which is what do we expect how are we thinking about ongoing migration of noninterestbearing into interestbearing in the current environment and how that affects our nii outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits and the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen so if you think about it in the wholesale space you have a bunch of clients with some balances and noninterestbearing accounts and over time for a variety of reasons we do see them moving those balances into interestbearing so we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore that will be a source of headwinds and that migration sometimes happens internally ie out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing or into cds sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments which is what we see happening in our wealth management business and some of it does leave the company but one of the things that were encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield seeking flow through cds and money market offerings et cetera across our various franchises so big picture i do think that migration out of', 'noninterestbearing into interestbearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for nii right now but yeah ill leave it at that i guess', 'very good and as a followup youve been very clear about the consumer credit card chargeoffs and delinquency levels and we all know about the commercial real estate office and you always talk about overearning on net interest income of course one of the great credit quality stories for everyone including yourselves is the ci portfolio how strong its been in this elevated rate environment and i know your numbers are still quite low but in the corporate and investment bank you had about a  million pickup in nonaccrual loans can you share with us what are you seeing in ci are there any early signs of cracks or anything and again i know your numbers are still good but im just trying to look forward to see if theres something here over the next  months or so', 'yeah its a good question i think the short answer is no were not really seeing early signs of cracks in ci i mean yes i agree with you like the ci chargeoff rate has been very very low for a long time i think we emphasized that at last years investor day if i remember correctly i think the ci chargeoff rate weve seen in  years was something like literally zero so that is clearly very low by historical standards and while we take a lot of pride in that number and i think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team thats not – we dont actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation so you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that but in any given quarter the ci numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic so i dont think that anything in the current quarters results is indicative of anything broader and i havent heard anyone internally talk that way i would say', 'hi good morning i just had one cleanup question jeremy the consensus provision for  is  billion could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of jamies comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that  billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in card', 'yeah happy to clarify that so jamies comments were that the allowance – the build and the card allowance so were talking about card specifically we expected something like  billion for the full year as i sit here today our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher but its in the ballpark and i think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year last time i checked it still looked a little low on that front so who knows what itll actually wind up being but that remains our view one question that weve gotten is how to reconcile that build to the  growth in os that weve talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth but the reason', 'thats the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that  as well as seasoning of earlier vintages which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of os growth', 'thanks erika operator and for our final question well go to the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please go ahead', 'oh hey good morning maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital it seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book so maybe two questions there one trading assets were up  yearover year is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand and is there further opportunities to grow that and then secondly outside of card loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if youre seeing any change in demand or how youre thinking about loan demand going forward thanks', 'thanks jim good questions so yeah trading assets have been up that is basically client activity primarily secured financingrelated sort of matchbook repotype stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit but are quite low risk and therefore quite low rwa intensity so while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that were happy about and its very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients its not really particularly rwa and therefore capital intensive and therefore doesnt really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital so to speak on the loan demand front yeah i mean unfortunately i just dont have much new to say there on loan demand meaning to your point loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except card our card business is of course in no way capital constrained so whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth thats going to make sense and so were very happy to deploy capital to that but its not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that and of course for the rest of the loan space the last thing that were going to do is have the excess capital meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure so theres always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly that is in some sense a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now when i talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are now would be it in terms of being patient thats a little bit one example of what i was referring to', 'right okay great thanks', 'thanks jim operator we have no further questions very good thank you everyone see you next quarter operator thank you all for

billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by higher compensation including revenuerelated compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees longterm net inflows were  billion for the quarter led by fixed income and equities in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and client assets of  trillion were up  yearonyear driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels and finally loans were up  yearonyear and  quarteronquarter and deposits were up  yearonyear and  sequentially turning to corporate corporate reported net income of  billion and includes the tax item i mentioned upfront revenue was  billion for the quarter nii was  billion down  million yearonyear nir was a net gain of  million up  million yearonyear excluding the prior years visarelated gain expenses  million were down  million yearonyear excluding the foundation contribution from the prior year that i mentioned earlier to finish up ill touch on the outlook youll recall that at investor day i made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook so now let me formalize that and give you updated guidance first we now expect nii ex markets to be approximately  billion with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in payments securities services as well as balanced growth in card total nii guidance is now about  billion implying  billion of markets nii second on adjusted expense we now expect it to be about  billion primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar which is largely bottom line neutral and finally on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately  so reflecting on the quarter while the environment remains extremely dynamic in many ways navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients', 'great good morning thanks for the question jamie relative to three months ago theres a lot of optimism', 'just wanted to welcome you to the call before we get started', 'great thanks so much relative to three months ago theres a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the banks favor im interested if you agree number one with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to and secondarily on capital im interested in whats on or off the table in terms of uses of capital what do you need to see from the macro regulatory and how should we be thinking about the timing thank you', 'let me take the second part of that first so we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot and i dont want to bore you by reciting it again but i think its important because it does serve as a guide in this context right so we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth and we ensure a sustainable dividend and with whats left we do buybacks and so weve talked about how excess capitals earnings in store you saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant the cet ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in rwa expansion so were doing what we want to do but clearly it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is and that includes potentially inorganic things now obviously that needs to be done carefully i think acquisitions have a high bar both financially strategically and importantly in some cases culturally and we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well we have learned some lessons we dont want to overlearn those lessons but in the end sometimes we lean in a little more sometimes we lean in a little less but we wouldnt be doing our jobs if we werent thinking about it i dont particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not that the regulatory environment right now particularly shapes our thinking on that front', 'can i say just a broader point about regulations i think its very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now not just one picture so nothings happened yet i think they should be looking at all these things but if you look at slr gsifi ccar basel iii fsrt the overlap the duplication i actually believe that you can make the system simpler cheaper more effective more transparent and safer and the things like silicon valley bank and first republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity more loans and a safer system and thats really what they should be looking at not just slr and so im hoping that over time they do that and the second thing id add to that which i think is even maybe more important is they should ask the question what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets et cetera weve gone from  public companies im talking about like  years ago to  today thats happened overseas public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller obviously im not against private credit private credit is growing and how do you really want to structure this and why is it happening is that a good thing for america', 'and so i just – it is time that they take a step back i hear sometimes from some pundits that theres been relaxing of rules and regulations absolutely not theres been nothing but increasing them for the better part of  years they should take a deep breath step back and look at the system and answer the question how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved', 'and maybe sort of gone a bit long here but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there i will note that vice chair bowman gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation and i think its a speech thats pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what jamie is saying in terms of like the todo list i think at the margin we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the todo list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like slr but at the same time that that happens the holistic review done properly across not only capital but also liquidity resolution et cetera is clearly quite important more narrowly in the near term i think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there one of the worst is gsib in the sense of both the original gold plating the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect and i think one of the things thats maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for american banks to be strong and globally competitive and that is it seems to me the exact opposite of what we want so thats really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively i would say', 'i appreciate all the color if could ask kind of a followup the inorganic comments im interested in capital allocation between your businesses where you think – if that were to present an opportunity which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital thanks', 'i mean weve talked about that a little bit over time obviously were not fundamentally capital constrained right now so i mean in addition to the fact that capital isnt the only financial resource that we need to allocate i would say the larger point is that any good franchise business that it makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done within reason subject to obvious caveats so', 'inorganic its a good discipline to always be looking i wouldnt have high expectations that will be how we use a lot of capital and i think its a very big plus that we can grow organically in every business were in without having to stretch', 'thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed', 'so two questions first on the rwa utilization via organic as you described i wanted to understand in wholesale lending where you highlighted the cib was a driver of much of this could you speak to the drivers of those drivers in other words is it private credit is it ma financing is it inventory what are you seeing in the market here that youre delivering on thats raising that lending profile', 'its all of the above betsy because we are the switzerland of financing we do everything and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter', 'okay oh great all right thank you and then jamie theres been a lot of discussion around stablecoin how stablecoin is going to be impacting banks and i believe you have an opinion on this would love to hear if you could highlight how jpm is thinking about utilizing leveraging competing with stablecoin and how the jpmd deposit token feeds into all of this as well thank you', 'so deposit token is effectively the same thing youre moving money by token you can pay interest its jp morgan deposit and stablecoin – were going to be involved in both jp morgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it to be good at it we dont know exactly – i think theyre real but i dont know why youd want a stablecoin as opposed to just payment but i do think you have fintech these guys are very smart theyre trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts and get into payment systems and rewards programs and we have to be cognizant of that the way to be cognizant is to be involved so were going to be in it and learning a lot and a player', 'okay super and then separately on the topic of open banking i think thats on hold right now with the cfpb on hold right now but just wanted to understand does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how youre pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here', 'so this is very important so forget pricing for a second we are in favor of the customer but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information what we ask people to do is what do they – do they actually know whats being shared what is actually being shared it shouldnt be everything it should be what their customer wants it should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years it should not be remarketed or resold to third parties and so were kind of in favor of all that done properly and then the payment it just costs a lot of money to set up the apis and stuff like that to run the systems protection so we just think it should be done and done right and thats the main part its not like you cant do it the last thing is a liability shift i mean i dont think jpmorgan should be responsible if youve given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it and then you get scammed or fraud through them they should be responsible and we want real clarity about that and if you see today a lot of these scams and frauds run through third party social media and stuff like that there should be a little more responsibility on their part so we can all do a better job for the customer thats why', 'excellent okay thank you so much for that', 'thanks betsy operator thank you next we will go to the line of steven alexopoulos from td cowen you may proceed', 'hey good morning everyone i wanted to start jeremy going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital so when i look at the company so youre the largest us bank by assets youre also the largest in terms of the data you see every day and you may or may not have seen that apples looking at possibly theres chatter getting into the ai game more by looking at a company such as a perplexity just thinking out loud here would it make sense for jpmorgan to consider acquiring an llm right the last two quarters of buybacks are about the last valuation round for perplexity right im thinking of you guys you could become the llm for the financial services industry what are your thoughts on this', 'we use llms and were going to be agnostic about that too theres no reason for us to own one at least we cant figure out why that would make sense', 'we will use it and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers', 'yeah and on the question of inorganic deployment i would sort of blend my comments with jamies right in the end im just asserting that of course we need to look at inorganic opportunities and of course thats a question that comes up given our current excess capital position but jamie said clearly that he doesnt think thats particularly likely for some of the reasons that you emphasized its not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense', 'we do a lot of small ones by the way which youve seen', 'yeah yeah okay and then going back jamie to your answer to betsys question on the tokenized deposit i get it how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden but it doesnt help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden whats holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint – similar somewhat to what youve done with zelle and prevent these stablecoin companies like circle coming in offering a more convenient solution to your customers', 'thats a great question and well leave it it remaining as a question', 'without an answer', 'well steven youre raising a very important point about interoperability of stablecoins and deposits and movement of money and what problem youre trying to solve but youre raising great points you can assume were thinking about all that', 'okay fair enough thanks for taking my questions operator thank you next we will go to the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed', 'good morning this almost sounds like a fintech and ai call but maybe just switching gears i think jamie your comments in the press release give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the us whats the state of play there when we think about interest rates tariffs consumer spending slowing should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out    months just whats your take based on all the data that you all look at', 'you jeremy can answer the thing about the data but very important we love the middle market business it drives a lot of business weve built i think  bankers in the innovation economy which is kind of new to us think of what silicon valley bank used to do and things like that we still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business we provide not just lending and that could be leverage lending direct lending but payment services custody services asset management services fx services so were going to grow that business regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next six or nine months', 'got it and i guess just as a follow on', 'go ahead jeremy yeah', 'no no go ahead ask your followup', 'and i was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play the health of the balance sheets of these customers and also if you can expand that into the consumer any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you are beginning to get more concerned today versus three or six months ago', 'yeah right okay because thats what i was going to try to clarify just wasnt sure if you were doing consumer wholesale or both so lets do consumer quickly i think we talk about this every quarter its obviously a very important question we look at it very closely it obviously matters a lot for us as a company but we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness we just – the consumer basically seems to be fine now a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress not surprisingly you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands but thats always true thats pretty much definitionally true and nothing there is out of line with our expectations our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations you saw that we kept our net chargeoff guidance unchanged so all of that looks kind of fine', 'and to be honest as weve said before fundamentally while there are nuances around the edges consumer credit is primarily about the labor market and in a world with  unemployment rate its just going to be hard especially in our portfolio to see a lot of weakness now it is true that if you look at not our data but the governments data i think i was looking at this the other day like first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down now its still positive its still growing but its down so its kind of consistent this sort of soft landing narrative which is also consistent with the sort of the gdp outlook that our economists are publishing our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period so its kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions but nothing particularly concerning', 'that was helpful and would you say the same about commercial', 'i mean basically yes you see some idiosyncratic things here and there and on the point of tariffs i guess obviously you recall the slide that we did at investor day kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins their sensitivity to input costs their amount of pricing power their amount of leverage and where the rules actually land but people are obviously getting some time to adjust and were watching it very closely so well see', 'helpful thank you', 'thanks operator thank you thank you our next question comes from john mcdonald with truist securities your line is open', 'hi good morning jeremy quick followup on the consumer credit broader comments taken there but in terms of the npas the nonaccruals in consumers seem to have a bit of a jump is there something technical there maybe just talk to that', 'yeah thanks for that john im glad to get a chance to clarify this there is something technical which has to do with home lending customers in the la area using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires so that is resulting in an uptick in the nonperforming but when you think about land value and the insurance there the actual loss expectation is de minimis i would say so', 'we always do that for customers when they have a real difficult time', 'exactly so thats whats driving that one', 'okay great and i wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits maybe in the context of mariannes presentation from investor day could you remind us of whats given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid to uppersingle digit deposit growth that marianne talked about', 'yeah sure so i think what youre referring to is a slide where marianne talked about kind of the potential for  consumer deposit growth next year and thats a nice number and as youve written that would produce some nice revenue consequences all else being equal the way i think about that number is to kind of build it up stepbystep so you start with in general the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal gdp a thing thats been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices weve probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows with the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us and youve got some core growth reasserting itself you saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter and thats one of the key drivers and then as you know well when you look at the franchise we kind of have number one ongoing expansion number two seasoning of the old expansion and number three deepening in the core markets so when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro environment et cetera thats how you get to that type of  number and obviously things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number among other things youll recall that mariannes slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which perhaps somewhat nonintuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate but the flip side of that is also true which is an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth all else equal in consumer so we like to say those are all else being equal type numbers but all else is never equal', 'got it great thank you', 'thanks a lot john operator thank you next we will go to the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open', 'hi hey jeremy can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography and jamie can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future consistent with what the treasury secretary said is his goal thanks', 'yeah thanks mike so on loan growth as you know its useful to sort of break this down between what i would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks et cetera that part of the franchise remains fine but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general but as i noted i think previously and as you see coming through the ib fee performance there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter a lot of which is well known and public and some of that is on our balance sheet and were very happy to have it there', 'to answer your other question mike so some of the – im going to give you some things that you can actually do so i think you should do them and reduce risk in the system im only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second and so gsifi inhibits if you look at it both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making lcr inhibits both because its a very rigid way of looking at a banks balance sheet it doesnt really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that ccar in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘ccarness but theres a lot of ‘ccarness from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility and ccar capital the fsrt the fundamental book when you look at all these things i think you can create more lending more liquidity more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system and also just cet just capital usage et cetera and the reducing the risk in the system i think you also make it friendlier for community banks which we do want to do and so if you look at like total loan to deposits they used to be  theyre now  thats a huge difference that took place over  or  years and can you get that back to  and have the banking system be just safe and sound absolutely', 'you didnt mention the cost to make a loan is there a potential for streamlining there', 'yes and i would put securitizations in that category we need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan i pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost  or  or  basis points more because of excessive securitization origination and servicing requirements those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages particularly for low income individuals and we just have failed to do it for  years and it wouldnt create any additional risk and we can show you data that shows that', 'and last one when you say inorganic growth would you buy a private credit firm is that something youd at least consider', 'i would say its not high on my list because we can do it ourselves and then you know buying people and comp plans and i also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit i dont know that but we already do it so if it was the right people the right price the right – sure we should look at it i think mike you should always be open minded when people come to you with something you hadnt thought about before and you just get smarter by looking at these things', 'actually i cant leave on that comment peak private credit i cant leave on those three words what do you mean by peak private credit', 'ive mentioned that credit spreads are very low its grown dramatically over time and you have to pay up a lot for it im not saying its not going to grow some more but i would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was but your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadnt thought about that is a complete natural fit for us natural fit being product and people and culture', 'sorry jeremy', 'no i was literally going to say what jamie just said so were good', 'all right thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of erika najarian with ubs you may proceed', 'hey good morning jamie and jeremy youve talked about simplifying the regulatory construct and it seems like based on the progress so far well mostly get there particularly with basel iii endgame and gsib which impacts you so much and to that end if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints does that move up jpmorgans natural rotce you talked  throughthecycle a lot obviously perhaps we would optimize the denominator why wouldnt that be additive to your natural rotce or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing', 'in a competitive world it is irrational to think that – and when it applies to all the competitors – that everybodys just going to make a lot more money you keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace hopefully well still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else but no i dont think you should automatically say its going to increase your returns remember jeff bezos says “your margin is my opportunity” that would be a huge opportunity for fintech private credit alternative players et cetera so you have to be a little careful to think that would happen i think its a good thing for the system though', 'yeah exactly and as we always say erika right like the market is very competitive and the returns are high and you know this but i would just refer you to the slide that i delivered at investor day about how in some cases it makes all else equal compared to buying back shares at these prices doing healthy well underwritten compelling franchise business with a  return were definitely supposed to do that actually and if we do a lot of that it will dilute down the weightedaverage rotce of the company in ways that are nonetheless clearly accretive to shareholders so', 'and jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns and not that you shouldnt do low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff if you didnt do it you might lose the other but there are some businesses out there with very high returns that we just grow we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches or products not directly by deploying capital so just think of branches that does it or private banking or things like that', 'yeah for sure and i think thats a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the eps gains rather than just rotce improvement and the second question i had is you mentioned and clearly we saw it in the numbers a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels and im wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half is it – did activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table is it the tax bill certainty i guess im just wondering has some of the issues that prevented activity levels or really stunted it in april and early may have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here', 'jeremy you might want to say – ill just answer your question by saying honestly we dont know and youve seen how rapidly whole pipelines can grow and shrink and so that lesson weve learned over and over and it may stay wide open for a year and a half something may happen geopolitically then all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit and so im always a little cautious to guess what thats going to be but if it continues this way yeah youre going have very active buckets', 'yeah and my version of that erika would be to say that you talked about certain of the tail risks getting taken completely off the table and thats clearly not true right all the tail risks are all still there quite prominently and in many cases in the daily news flow maybe at the margin the tails are a little bit less fat right now i think its also true that in terms of our – what the things that weve said about our investment banking pipeline have been consistently quite cautious and at a certain point when you have the type of outperformance that you have this quarter it starts to make your cautiousness', 'seem less credible so we wanted to take a hard look at ourselves and say what do we really think and its like yeah the sentiment is better but as jamie says like that can change overnight and there are lot of risks out there', 'i do think that extending the tax bill for businesses to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward and that does reduce the risk that the bill didnt get done i also think when it comes to tariffs i think the initial liberation day – now theres more talk theres more things getting done a couple have been announced a couple have been delayed that reduces that risk a little bit and hopefully theyll get done theres still risk out there but i am hopeful some of these frameworks are completed soon at least before august ', 'thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities your line is open', 'hey good morning thanks for taking the questions maybe just on – jeremy if i look at your q and k rate sensitivity disclosures it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve so can you talk about what youve been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet whether extending duration or hedges and is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as i guess the markets expect later this year thanks', 'now before he goes on what the market expects is almost what never happens', 'fair enough', 'all right so its a good question jim but yeah as jamie points out just remember that to the extent that the market is efficient which maybe its not but you cant really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in right so thats worth saying out loud but i mean you can decrease volatility but its just a question of now or later but having said that on the question of decreasing volatility we did in fact add some duration this quarter with the usual mix of instruments and strategies but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios at least narrowly through the lens of nii', 'as weve talked about a little bit over time though i like the way you framed it in terms of like having the capacity and i think the way to think about it there is that in general its almost impossible to get your asset – for a bank like us its almost impossible to get your asset sensitivity – your actual asset sensitivity down to zero because you wind up constrained by other things so were in the corridor and were okay with where we are right now', 'okay thanks and maybe just one more on the regulatory front i think regulators look at reducing the slr as a way to encourage banks or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheets into lower risk assets do you see that is it really just a supply issue or how do you think about the demandsupply dynamic and is there really opportunities for you to grow i would imagine i guess with an slr not being constrained maybe its better return in lower margin areas just your thoughts', 'yeah its a good question you may recall i actually got a version of this question at investor day so ill almost repeat my answer here which is that as we know fixing slr has been on the list for a long time it behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big qe when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system its the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures and so we dont want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis its just not the right way to run the railroad i think everyone has agreed on that for a long time and in that context its been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed but its a good sign that its now out there and wed certainly support the proposal there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested but at a high level its a good proposal its the right thing to do and its the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that weve got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons but yeah as you note and as weve said were not really bound by it i think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it there are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which i would expect to be very small versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses which may be where you would hope to see the effect so its a good thing hopefully it will help obviously its pretty fully priced in at this point so i dont think youre going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of its eventually being finalized because i think everyones assuming it will go in roughly in its current form', 'and im like a broken record its not slr its lcr its gsifi its ccar its basel iv the gold plating you really got to step back and look at all of them and how you use the discount window et cetera and even how you measure liquidity which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery they should look at all of that if they really want to fix the system', 'all right thanks for the color', 'thanks operator thank you next we will go to the line of ken usdin from autonomous you may proceed', 'thanks good morning first question is i just wanted to ask you about the recent sapphire price changes and just what youre seeing in terms of initial response and just how that fits in strategically with the competitive landscape on card and your growth opportunity', 'so far', 'going fine were happy in terms of the strategic aspects of this and the competitive landscape i think the way we think about this is as a normal course refresh of one of our important products and the way that all of our products get refreshed periodically obviously this is a relatively high profile product many of us have the card we see the ads everywhere so it sort of punches above its weight in that respect in terms of visibility in terms of the competitive landscape i think a thing that we feel really great about is the dramatic increase in the customer value proposition associated with the card and in particular one of the things that we look at is the ratio of the customer value to the annual fee which is clearly market leading at this point so', 'i got a lot of comments that people – from friends of my kids and stuff like that that man you have got to raise the card but you have to keep it for the laguardia lounge and thats the value added jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorganchase and then some theres a lot of value added', 'yeah and obviously i mean were not going to talk too much about competitors but as you know the card space is very competitive and very dynamic so we exist in a competitive landscape and this is our best foot forward on this product at this moment in time', 'got it it is quite a nice lounge on the trading side just wondering how much – the strong results this quarter the quarter changed a lot from april to june and im just wondering how much you think that was environmental has it calmed down at all and also how much is just your ability to kind of use the balance sheet to boost results also could that make it more sustainable regardless of what the environment is doing thanks a lot', 'good question honestly i think its kind of all of the above basically no question that the tone shifted obviously it shifted in investment banking i think i personally was a little bit surprised by the resilience of the markets revenues in the second half of the quarter because i was sort of expecting a little bit of an offset between the two', 'i was not surprised jeremy barnum', 'but its not like i thought it would do badly but it sort of did quite well in the volatility in the first half of the quarter and then it got quiet but despite that we still did nicely and i think the point actually sort of to your question is that yes we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources and yeah maybe at the margin that does contribute a little bit to durability weve talked over time about the markets revenues and the dramatic increase obviously  is a long time ago at this point and we should expect those revenues to grow with gdp anyway but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate and then we kind of stopped worrying about that and now of course theyve gone up to new highs so maybe we should be worried again but a thing i like to remind myself of to your point is that while the revenues have gone up a lot the resource usage has also gone up a lot so we are deploying a lot of capital and other resources in this business and were earning good returns on it but the revenue growth is not coming for free so its us running the place basically', 'thanks a lot operator thank you next we will go to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open', 'matt youve got some major static on the line i dont know if were going to be able to hear you just give it a shot give it a shot', 'can you hear me better now', 'not really but lets try lets try', 'i just wanted to ask about any pressure from commercial and corporate customers to try to offset the tariff impact from regional banks that pointed to deposit pricing pressure on the commercial side and if youre seeing any signs of that or more broadly speaking thank you', 'i think if i heard the question correctly you were asking', 'are you offsetting tariff pressure with pressure on loans or deposits the answer is no', 'the answer is no yeah', 'i wish we could say more about it but we think the answer is no', 'no i mean theres always pressure in some of those', 'its a competitive market right there is ongoing – deposits are very very competitive and there are always pricing conversations as there should be its hard to know in any given moment whats driving it but i havent heard anything to support a tariff linked narrative operator thank you next we will go to the line of glenn schorr with evercore your line is open', 'hi thanks just two quick follow ups on the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines i know weve been here before and markets can giveth and taketh away but there is a time value in there meaning corporates and more importantly sponsors need to get stuff done there is a ton of dry powder so im curious if theres a higher level of confidence meaning if the market doesnt take from us is it really happening this time weve been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now does it feel more doable as long as the market doesnt take the rug out from under us', 'i think it separates sponsorowned companies from ipos there are companies going public theyre in the pipeline they want to go public et cetera sponsors are still at least from what i can tell anecdotally still reluctant to use the public markets there obviously maybe more of it but it hasnt been a mountain of stuff coming out', 'yeah i think thats right in the ipo space at least for now but i have heard some things to support some elements of your narrative glenn the effect of that – now there is pressure to kind of recycle capital and get things done and yeah sure after the initial shock of tariff policy changes everyone kind of went on hold but as weve noted in our comments a few times today at a certain moment you just have to move on with life and it does feel like some of that is happening just because you cant delay forever', 'i hear you the followup on the capital conversation obviously impressive to see big returns on even higher capital bases but theres more to come and i think trend is your friend on dereg so the question is you keep making a lot of money your capital base keeps rising youve talked about arresting the growth of cet in the past but i guess my blunt question is is there any valuation limitation towards that arresting of cet', 'okay wait i want to say a couple of things and then i want to clarify an aspect of your question glenn so first on arresting the growth what i actually said not to nitpick on you but i said arresting the growth of excess capital which i agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant cet as it happened this quarter you see the cet actually dropping about  basis points and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in rwa usage which we were frankly like very happy to see in fact so thats all to the good in some sense now the other part of your question can you just repeat it i want to make sure i understand it', 'im just curious if theres a valuation limitation to the thinking meaning as valuation goes up do you keep buying back stock', 'meaning would we go back to a moment of reducing buybacks and starting to build again if the stock gets even more expensive i mean i think thats the question for the boss but i dont know i guess we always reserve the right to do whatever we want on buybacks basically', 'we reserve the right were not going to tell you but obviously as stock price – i mean dont like buying back the stock at almost three times tangible book no ones going to convince me thats a brilliant thing to do but it is wise to use our balance sheet for customers which were doing and we can possibly do more and it is probably wise to not increase the excess capital anymore since we have plenty and its going be going up look im completely convinced if you take out of your mindset  months we will use the capital wisely for shareholders', 'you always do all right thank you', 'the best way is organic growth which i wouldnt rule out that we can find more ways to grow clients basically operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is open', 'hi jeremy hi jamie id like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed obviously you had a very strong number this quarter  when you adjusted for the onetime effect and you go back to your investor day and you pointed out  is what the targeted level is and if you turn back the clock and go back to  you had the same  goal for the rotce but your cet ratio back then was – excuse me guidance was  to  so my question is has the business for you folks changed so much that now its just inherently a more profitable business or are there some onetime – not onetime items but are there some tailwinds that are artificially – i hate to use that word but are they inflating the rotce which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from ', 'jeremy can answer this but this will be an important point the value to shareholders is that we can not just earn  rotce and that we can reinvest money at  rotce thats the value if youre just going to earn  youre a bond you will trade three times tangible book but thats it for the rest of your life and so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your business which we are doing if you look at it we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally and when you look at the midcap business were doing in europe its been great innovation economy has been great were gaining shares in lot of places chase wealth management and the private bank the international private bank payment systems were investing in all those things to grow our franchises and thats the best way to use your capital and forget the timetable of that that is the best way to use it', 'yeah and gerard i guess on your other question its an interesting question i dont think the answer is really knowable and i feel like its kind of all of the above let me say what i mean like on the one hand i think if you look at the current market environment its hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us right rates are at a good level for us deal activity is high capital markets are very strong consumer credit is excellent wholesale credit is excellent wealth management asset management essentially every part of the company is firing were essentially firing on all cylinders with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive like home lending where theyre still doing a great job in what is a very tough market so when you see that youre like well thats not normal normally you would have some pockets doing a little better some pockets doing a little worse and thats part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable on the other hand its also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well and weve been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasnt that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that jamies talking about some of those investments in various ways are paying off so', 'you have – all of our major bank competitors are back and growing and expanding you have the fintech folks who are quite capable and quite smart who want to take big chunks of your business everything we do is kind of competitive around the world so the notion that somehow were not going deal with our competitors which protects jpmorganchase we dont get complacent we dont get arrogant we dont get bureaucratic and we keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day and so were quite cautious to just declare victory like somehow were entitled to these returns forever also pointed out if you could compound at  actually i had jeremy do his number one point if you compounded  for  years you probably would have a good chunk of the gdp of united states of america for  years maybe', 'yeah i always have to go put new batteries in my hp c when you ask me that question all right yeah', 'jeremy im glad youre still using hp c thats good just as a followup', 'he just uses his big brain he doesnt need the c', 'its not true because if – can we not do that', 'just as a quick followup jeremy in the markets comment that you made you said that there were fewer opportunities in securitized products and fixed income financing can you expand upon that or give us any color there thank you', 'yeah sure i mean its just normal diversification inside the markets business those businesses are doing great but like at the margin in the second half of the quarter stuff was a little quieter relative to emerging markets and the macro space which was a little bit better', 'nothing too dramatic', 'hey good morning thanks for taking my question just one for me i just want to followup on kens question about sales and trading and i think you kind of addressed this jeremy but i just – youve had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional q on the back of a really strong  i mean how are you thinking about how much of this really is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something thats more durable and presumably less volatility good for investment banking but do you see – would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result or do you think theres still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share im just curious how much – how you think about whats exceptional versus whats more durable here', 'yeah i mean one thing ill say is that theres no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results so its pretty broad based and its not particularly lumpy and as i said i think it is true and i think weve shared some of this in different ways including in my slide at investor day that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like gsib capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue and were happy with the returns but its not just like growing without any inputs essentially so i guess on the one hand you might say that thats a bit more durable for that reason but it is important to realize that its coming with that use of resources essentially so i mean weve gotten over time a little bit more relaxed about talking about the markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues', 'its obviously extremely client centric theres a lot of financing of various types thats being supplied and it seems to if anything more often than not be countercyclical rather than procyclical but its still markets right things can happen its volatile theres risk taking involved thats part of the point that we build sorry to hedge the answer but thats kind of how we think about it', 'thats fine thanks a lot guys operator thank you our final question comes from chris kotowski with oppenheimer your line is open', 'yeah good morning and thanks kind of an old school bank analyst question after a long time of kind of bemoaning slow ci loan growth you had this extraordinary growth this quarter  billion in average and more than  quarteroverquarter but then when we look at the pl in the commercial  investment bank net interest income is down  and lending income is down  and i know theres hedges and other complicated things but it just kind of doesnt compute that youd have such strong loan growth and not have revenue growth associated with that', 'yeah i mean the hedges are definitely part of it and a lot of the assets came on the balance sheet quite late in the quarter so i dont know i might be missing something theres probably some markets it theres markets nii piece of it too so i dont know mikael can followup with you but i think the loans thing is part of it markets nii is part of it and late quarter…', 'hedging', 'hedges for sure yeah', 'thanks operator thank you we have no further questions thanks very much jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorganchase and thank you

want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on israel and the resulting bloodshed and more terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at jpmorgan chase go out to all who are suffering thanks jamie and of course i very much echo the sentiment now lets turn to our third quarter earnings results the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion and delivered an rotce of  these results included  million of net investment securities losses in corporate and  million of firmwide legal expense on page  we have some more detail similar to last quarter we have called out the impact of first republic where relevant for this quarter first republic contributed  billion of revenue  million of expense and  billion of net income now focusing on the firmwide results excluding first republic revenue of  billion was up  billion or  yearonyear nii ex markets was up  billion or  driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in card partially offset by lower deposit balances nir ex markets was up  million or  which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year and markets revenue was down  million or  yearonyear expenses of  billion were up  billion or  yearonyear primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense and credit costs were  billion predominantly driven by net chargeoffs in card and included a  million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario primarily offset by card loan growth on to balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  up about  basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by aoci we had  billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the basel iii endgame proposal in line with our capital hierarchy we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge and on the topic of the basel iii endgame youll see that we added a couple of pages on it so lets cover that now starting on page  given the significance of this proposal for us the broader industry as well as households and businesses as endusers we thought it was important to spend time discussing it and while we know theres interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail its important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are wellcapitalized and wellpositioned to deal with stress given that context the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and theres a lot that does not make sense to us starting with rwa weve already said we expect the firms rwa to increase by around  or  billion which results in capital requirements increasing by about  or  billion one immediate thing to point out is that at  gsib a  billion increase in rwa requires  billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint weve been on the record for a long time the gsib was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally since implementation the failure to address economic growth despite the fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse and now all of those problems are being applied to an additional  billion of rwa our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with gsib buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the rwa increase by the existing surcharges another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of rwa for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer although theres limited disclosure from the fed on this point we have estimated that we have about  billion of operational risk capital embedded in the scb based on the information the fed does disclose once we capitalize with this new op risk rwa our required capital will go up by around  billion without any change to our portfolio now lets turn to page  which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal this page reminds us of whats happened since  since then saccr and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our gsib surcharge will increase to  so assuming the basel iii endgame and gsib proposals are finalized in their current form we would see a  increase in our capital requirements relative to that  starting point this illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are and its not done yet we still expect the fed to incorporate cecl into ccar which will likely increase the scb and of course given the absence of a fix to the gsib flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future and aside from those dynamics there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework we think its also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here while it may technically be true that the proposal is basel compliant basel compliance does not mandate a  increase in capital requirements implementing the basel iii endgame consistently with how the europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of gsib and scb would have achieved basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements as you would expect we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail for the purposes of this call we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the frameworks durability over time the current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification if it goes through as written there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers in addition the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the us capital markets we believe that wellregulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth depth and resilience of the american capital markets which is vital to the us economy so caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude with that lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  consumer spend growth has now reverted to prepandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat yearonyear cash buffers continued to normalize to prepandemic levels with lower income groups normalizing faster turning now to the financial results excluding first republic ccb reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion which was up  yearonyear in banking  wealth management revenue was up  yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates endofperiod deposits were down  quarteronquarter we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on fdic data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets client investment assets were up  yearonyear driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yieldseeking flows from our consumer banking customers in home lending revenue was down  yearonyear given a smaller market originations of  billion were up slightly quarteron quarter but they remain down  yearonyear moving to card services  auto – revenue was up  yearonyear driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up  yearonyear due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were up  billion up  yearonyear as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by continued investments in staffing primarily in front office and technology in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were  billion driven by net chargeoffs which were up  million yearonyear predominantly due to continued normalization of card the net reserve build of  million reflected a  million build in card services primarily offset by a  million release in home lending next the cib on page  cib reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion investment banking revenue of  billion was down  yearonyear ib fees were down  yearonyear and we ranked number one with a yeartodate wallet share of  in advisory fees were down  underwriting fees were up  for debt and down  for equity in terms of the outlook were encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in september and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter advisory has also picked up compared to the first half but yeartodate announced ma remains down significantly which will continue to be a headwind payments revenue was  billion up  yearonyear excluding equity investments it was up  driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances moving to markets – total revenue was  billion down  yearonyear against a very strong third quarter last year fixed income was up  driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in securitized products as well as improved performance in credit this was predominantly offset by currencies and emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year equity markets was down  reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prioryear quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility securities services revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation credit costs were net benefit of  million driven by a net reserve release of  million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net chargeoffs of  million moving to the commercial bank on page  commercial banking reported net income of  billion revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear with payments revenue of  billion up  yearonyear driven by higher rates and gross investment banking and markets revenue of  million was up  yearonyear reflecting increased ma volume expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by an increase in headcount including front office and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense including the impact of new client acquisition average deposits were down  year onyear  quarteronquarter primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives loans were up  quarteronquarter ci loans were flat reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization and cre loans were up  reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity finally credit costs were  million including net chargeoffs of  million and a net reserve build of  million then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  billion with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was relatively flat yearonyear as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower nii from deposits expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the jp morgan asset management china and global shares acquisitions for the quarter net longterm inflows were  billion positive across all asset classes led by equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion aum of  trillion was up  yearonyear and client assets of  trillion were up  yearonyear driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels finally loans were flat quarteronquarter while deposits were down  driven by migration to investments partially offset by client inflows turning to corporate on page  corporate reported net income of  million revenue was  billion up  billion compared to last year nii was  billion up  billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates and nir was a net loss of  million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront expenses of  million were up  million yearonyear to finish we have the outlook on page  we now expect  nii and nii ex markets to be approximately  billion and  billion respectively with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed consistent with what weve been saying throughout the year while we dont know when it will normalize we do not consider this level of nii to be sustainable our outlook for  adjusted expense is now approximately  billion and as a reminder this is on an adjusted basis which excludes legal expense also remember this outlook excludes the pending fdic special assessment and on credit we now expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be approximately  mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating results throughout the year weve been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those including the geopolitical situation economic outlook rate environment deposit reprice and the impact of the basel iii endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past but as always we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most', 'hi good morning jeremy i was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what youre seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration whats been better than expected so far on that front and how do you see higherforlonger rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure', 'sure thanks john i think the themes are pretty much the same as weve seen in prior quarters so as we talked a little bit about on the press call weve been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we dont think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that well have to reprice in some pockets to some degree maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future and of course that hasnt happened yet this year so thats one factor in the meantime the cd strategy is working well were getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and were capturing money in motion and so were seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of cd migration but thats sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan i would say in terms of higherforlonger i think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects and in the end as we always say were going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment', 'and just as a follow up it seems like youve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters how are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio given your outlook for rates', 'yeah i think i would say that while were not predicting higher rates i dont know if jamie will have something to say here we believe in being prepared for it and thats been our position for some time and of course thats produced good results and we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company so probably at the margin were still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates but do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side so that can be a factor as well', 'hi jeremy i was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook you cited improved activity levels in september but given persistently higher rates geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent ipos how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term and how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity', 'yeah good question i mean as you know obviously the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of  which is what you might consider the last normal year we do eventually think well recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime and to be fair while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out things have improved a little bit and i think i would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter so it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced ma and some regulatory headwinds on that side', 'thanks for the color just for my follow up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided certainly a lot of helpful color in the slides so thank you for that if the proposal were to go through as written what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time and was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think cecl inclusion could potentially impact the scb and ccar', 'yeah those are all good questions steve i think its probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front if i start first with the basel iii endgame proposal from our perspective were currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things i highlighted in my prepared remarks but some of them are sort of very technical in nature including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal and so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point i would point out that given how significant operational risk rwa is as part of the proposal that is you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense nonoptimizable so we feel that its important to manage expectations about the level of optimization thats possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed also it depends on your definition of optimization sometimes i use the term costless optimization whereas these technical fixes that dont affect revenue and dont require you to exit businesses i think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past but as we pointed out we may simply need to exit things and that will be because it is better than the alternative which would be to do activity thats shareholder value destructive but it wont be costless a good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense now thats one that we hope will be changed but its tricky because those are very long duration assets so between now and the rule is finalized it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet so sorry a bit of a long answer but then yeah on quantifying cecl and ccar i think we better wait for that one cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the feds exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth its a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting cecl and ccar is going to be we just know probabilistically that it will like everything else these days tend to push capital higher', 'very helpful color jeremy thanks for taking my question', 'hey good morning just first question jeremy on credit i think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario so just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today what changed and then in terms of fundamentally on credit like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side', 'yeah so on the central scenario you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team no but in all seriousness i think our us economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with i think two quarters of negative half a percent of gdp growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth i think around  for a few quarters into  so just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that were still skewed to the downside were still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weightedaverage basis than is in the central case outlook so that number weve sometimes given you is  this quarter so its really not much more complicated than that were just kind of following the process and i think your other question was where am i seeing softness in credit and i think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly were certainly nowhere thats not expected meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected and then of course we are seeing a trickle of chargeoffs coming through the office space you see that in the chargeoff number of the commercial bank but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that weve already built there', 'thats helpful and just going back to the details you laid out on basel endgame maybe on the philosophical side i think jamie was speaking last month said that we dont expect any changes but at the same time you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worstcase outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized', 'yeah so ill let jamie speak for himself on that point but our job is to advocate were not going to guess what the sentiment is in washington its a thousandpage rule proposal as you know weve got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely interestingly we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending they sort of forgot about like – the fed in their preamble they forgot about a  billion sic trillion of operational risk rwa so it just highlights that there is the possibility or seemed to have forgotten they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk rwa on fees so anyway the point is its long its complicated its technical we do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there were not going to forcefully advocate on all of those and while we disagree with a lot of this stuff these are technical issues that should be in some sense resolved technically and hopefully theyll listen', 'got it thank you', 'sorry im just getting a correction in the room i meant to say trillion', 'is that what we were talking about actually', 'bpi put something out on it', 'bpi did yeah thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan kenny with morgan stanley you may proceed', 'want to dig in on the nii side so you raised the  nii ex markets guidance by  billion for this year so i know your comments in the press release suggest jpmorgans over earning so i just want to triangulate there what does normalized nii look like and do we get to normalized next year or later on', 'yeah a couple things so let me do the timing question first so were being very clear that we are not predicting when when is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth so were just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates which we just dont fundamentally think are sustainable youll be aware that before investor day earlier this year we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like and we put a sort of mids type number out there and at investor day we talked about how the acquisition of first republic was going to push that number up a little bit although there was some overlap and so on and so forth so anyway with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit if you sort of push us for that kind of what is that number now look like we think its probably closer to about  billion with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we dont know when but were just trying to point out that its quite a bit lower than the current run rate', 'got it', 'inside the company some people think itll happen sooner ie me some people think itll happen later ie jenn and marianne and jeremy', 'i wasnt aware that i was in that camp actually', 'oh ok', 'but i dont know im not trying to have an opinion over you operator thank you', 'and then on the loan growth side industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year what demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories and i know it might be too early to talk about next year but directionally how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming', 'yeah sure so on loan growth the story is pretty consistent with what weve been saying all year so weve of course seen very robust loan growth in card and thats coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances as we look forward were still optimistic about that but itll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period', 'in auto weve also seen pretty robust loan growth recently both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates and so we lost some share previously and thats come back now and generally the supply chain situation is better so thats been supported as we look forward there it should be a little bit more muted and i think generally in wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment so depending on what you believe about soft landing mild recession no landing you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth but in any case i would expect it to be relatively muted and of course home lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions but also and i think this is true across the board we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of basel iii which may not change originations but it will change what we retain', 'good morning jeremy how are you', 'jeremy you guys have put up a really strong rotce number of  for the quarter and when you dive into your different segments what really jumps out at us is the  exfirst republic roe in consumer  community banking i know you and jamie have talked about your overearning on credit we get that but in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybodys market share you guys have put up great numbers here whats the drivers behind an roe even when you take that credit overearning out whats driving this business profitability at such high levels', 'yeah gerard so id say a couple things there so first its not just credit its also deposit margin right so when we talk about overearning on nii a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all of the reasons that weve talked about but i would also point out sometimes we dont like the word overearning because right now customers are happy and theyre doing cds and the broader answer to your question about why were able to be effectively really comes back to a decade two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that theres a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all of the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty and were seeing some of the benefits of that now although were not complacent the competition is still there the fintechs are still there and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value and its also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal but that core franchise is extremely robust', 'very good and then as a follow up which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and jamie about the internal debate inside jpmorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side your noninterestbearing deposits i think are around  of total deposits which is slightly above the  you guys had back in  or  or prepandemic is this expectation that youre going to see more of the noninterestbearing deposits go into interestbearing or is it just the repricing of interest bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside jpmorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number', 'yeah its a good question gerard i think its a little bit bigger picture than that and im not sure – i get your questions a good question but im not sure that the reported interestbearing noninterestbearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons so first like between wholesale and retail weve got some amount of noninterestbearing and wholesale thats part of the ecr product so you see some dynamics there that play out and in consumer in a world where savings is paying a relatively lowrate paid to crosschecking and savings the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now but then of course even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses youve got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances so i would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer thats driven by internal migration from checking savings to cds from ecr to interestbearing and wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment the competitive environment the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future', 'hi good morning jeremy my first question is for you again sort of maybe reasking the question in a different way your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of  billion in the fourth quarter as we think about the dynamics in higherfor longer on one hand your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice on the other you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher how do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of  billion in the fourth quarter', 'yeah so erika i think the simple answer to your question is i believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a  billion run rate ex markets and were kind of saying', ' billion', 'yeah isnt that what i meant to say', 'she said  billion', 'oh i didnt hear that okay anyway', 'we didnt model it that way', 'so call it  billion run rate on an exit rate basis and were saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to  billion so thats one building block underneath that i think one thing thats interesting actually is that as the percentage of the deposits which are cds increases the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume its a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration balances product level reprice as you get out of that lower zero bound with  cd mix world things get a little bit smoother i would say overall so itll be interesting to watch that but its obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it but its also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as weve often said were very focused on primary bank relationships and we didnt lose any of those in the last cycle and were not planning to lose any in this cycle and thats what sort of a longterm focus means for us', 'and i would just add quantitative tightening in there that will be a large number and we dont exactly know the effect where wholesale consumer as – remember also the fed has the rrp program which is also sucking money into the fed directly and reducing deposits thats still a trillion too', 'thank you and my second question is on maybe zooming out on the basel iii endgame impacts its clearly complex overly complex and i completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking i guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated  basis points of cet this quarter while your rwas are down and i guess my question here is is that i understand that were in the public advocacy process i hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for main street and dislocating the pipes in american capital markets but for jpmorgan does this change your natural return profile of  jamie i know you lingered a little bit on  when you were at barclays in september but at the end of the day it feels like for the portfolio managers that own jpmorgan through the cycle does basel iii endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns', 'yeah okay thats a good question erika i think theres a couple pieces in there so let me take the most important piece first which is the  through the cycle target are we keeping that or not in light of the basel iii endgame proposal so short answer is were not going to change that number today but when you look at what weve disclosed about a  increase in capital you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns', 'in simple terms you talk about earnings power and returns but theyre two different things right we have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here okay so say the numerator doesnt change if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital thats a significantly lower return number i would say that thats probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the basel iii endgame for a couple reasons one is we are hoping for changes two is once the rule is final we will seek to reprice in the places where we can and thatll be different in consumer and wholesale some of it will be product level some of it will be relationship level but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is thats cost getting passed into the real economy and thats part of the point that weve made about lowering availability of products and services and lending there may be some opportunities for costless optimization im personally a little bit more pessimistic about those but weve surprised ourselves on those points in the past so well see and then finally yeah we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things but i wouldnt necessarily assume that thats going to do a lot to preserve returns at the  thats going to be about exiting things that are shareholderdestructive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what i mean so thats that and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and i think its just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on longterm returns from our ability to meet the requirements of course as jamie always says jpmorgan is going to be fine and were building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and well be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve ontime or early compliance which is always what we strive to do but that doesnt really have any particular bearing on the question of what the longterm return target is or the impacts on the real economy', 'got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi you may proceed', 'hi thank you so i very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things whats going on in the world and their potential impact on markets on food markets global trade everything that you mentioned and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades the question i have is does it surprise you that markets are hanging in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while thats going on and then maybe more importantly if you believe what obviously what you wrote what are you doing about it how do you manage yourself conservatively how do you prepare for tougher times', 'go ahead jeremy', 'you want to start okay so i mean on green shoots youll just note that our comments are cautious i mean there is momentum i do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were but obviously markets have been bumpy both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently so we dont want to get too carried away with optimism here we are coming in off a very low base and so theres a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement and of course the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening so those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the nearterm but its tempered with quite a bit of caution', 'so i would add a question there has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system and you cant look at and of course it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that but you cant stay like this forever between qt if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor so i think people have to be very cautious and of course the geopolitics i think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with how do you prepare the company for that we do  stress tests a week and we do multiple views of it including geopolitical problems interest rate problems but usually geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession or a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot and because markets do well is not a reason ever to say that they are going to continue to do well if you dont believe me remember    the year  the year  and people dont predict those inflection points but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there you just got to be very cautious with what youre facing and like i said the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out better products and better services securely safely and all those things so thats the ultimate goal we know there are going to be bad times thats not a surprise that there are going to be bad times we dont always know how theyre coming and where theyre coming from but well keep on serving clients and doing good for clients you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns thats a slightly different issue at this point but well deal with that too when we figure out what to do', 'thanks glenn operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hi i understand the nii strategy benefited from first republic asset sensitivity cd strategy money in motion and im curious to how much is the nii increase and the deposit benefits a function of the  million digital banking customers do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now if you can just refresh that and then a more general question i guess i have the first one for jeremy and the second one for jamie you have record tech spend whats the benefit of having record tech spend if you can kind of marktomarket your thoughts there as it relates to ai as it relates to maybe wasted spending your outlook for next year and does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry', 'yes let me do digital banking mike i spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago and its interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts meaning that were continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged and it sort of goes back to my prior point jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorgan chase  co but the percent who are digital only is much lower than that', '', 'for sure for sure which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current nii story it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle multichannel fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches obviously but also in digital services of all sorts so in many ways you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment but thats not like therefore we stop investing obviously so i guess thats part of the answer and i guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender i just think like its sort of mandatory right i mean were big and its a very technologycentric business and the world is competitive and everything is changing younger generations have different expectations and we have to be nimble and we have to be on our front foot and otherwise we risk getting severely disrupted so i dont know if jamie wants to add anything', 'just the competition when we look at it its wells whos coming back which im happy for you guys its obviously marcus its apple its chime its dave there are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways and there some have been quite successful its stripe in payments and so we want to be very good and very competitive some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non which is cybersecurity data center resiliency regulatory requirements and things like that which we simply are going to do and be very very good at to protect the company', 'as it relates to ai specifically which is the talk of the town i guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle including jpmorgan you wont control the front end what are you doing with ai to make a difference now or is this just simply a moon shot', 'oh i dont agree with that statement banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model thats public data looking at everything on the internet or everything thats ever been published or something like that but ai is an extraordinarily good tool to use we just put a woman whos running it at our table so its data analytics ai et cetera and there are multiple types of ai so we use ai for risk fraud marketing prospecting and the management teams getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors to serve clients better to have a salesperson have copilots so they know to widen the clients coin or something like that and so we simply have to do it does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in yeah of course thats always been true with technology and but well be quite good at it', 'and then lastly i think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year where do you stand on that', 'yeah now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year so i think at the conference we said i think the consensus was  billion but were still going through the budget process et cetera et cetera so thats still true i think were still kind of in the ballpark but i would say at the margin theres going to be a little bit of upward pressure jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorgan chase  co is that for first republic too or no', '', 'yeah this is all now including first republic and i think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make so no surprise in that sense that were going to invest prudently nothing dramatic but probably a little bit of upward pressure at the margin', 'all right thank you', 'hey good morning jeremy do you think theres any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but i think you alluded to this earlier in the markets business but theres clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book is there any receptivity', 'can i just answer that real quickly we dont really know its a onesided conversation generally they say put it in your comments so everyone is going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from jeremy and we dont really know we dont really know whats going on inside the fed how many people get involved in my view its become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis i think is required to do it exactly right so well see', 'okay and then if it werent to change and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the markets business specifically is that a jpm pulling out of certain businesses type event or is it more a comment that thered be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit and maybe thats almost equal a market share gain opportunity for jpmorgan in a smaller business', 'i think so if you look at markets alone its a huge i think  increase in capital and if you look at it you can do that by product for some products its worse than for others but generally its bad across all products but the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments hospitals cities schools states imf world bank blackrock blackstone and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size and market makers have a different function than hedge funds and i dont know what the real intent was with this this is another one i think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish we do market making quite safe weve never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that but the other thing about market making i do agree it could actually force some people out it will force lower positions which is why i think its a little risky but it may also force more consolidation and so clients since they need it so much there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints with the lcr slr capital et cetera you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do', 'yeah and i think that last point of jamies is particularly important because sure if you want you can construct what i would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and thats a share gain opportunity for us but if i refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale getting bigger especially in markets is quite expensive from for example a gsib perspective and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why were sort of highlighting but it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything thats happened in markets over the last  years is a fundamentally very different system and while obviously', 'great opportunity for european market makers i mean a great opportunity like they can do repo and fx and swaps and credit and stuff with  less capital that is a big difference in that kind of business', 'right thats helpful thanks operator thank you our last question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open', 'hi good morning you talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term the outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income fees might help but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years so i know you always say you want to invest for the cycle and its really paid off over time but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years', 'yeah i mean i wish i had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework but in some fundamental sense we just kind of dont agree with the framework in the sense that and weve been through this over the last couple of years right in a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds and youve seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets we saw that in  going into  where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control and while of course there are parts of our expense base which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes but other things are much more structural and the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are so were always very focused on cost you can be rest assured of that that discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle but there are longterm plays and you really shouldnt expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didnt balloon the costs when the revenue became as weve argued unsustainably high', 'yeah fair enough and if i could just squeeze in on first republic obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higherthan expected how do you think about the puts and takes in terms of i think theres probably some runoff of loans still to come but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there', 'yeah so youre right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable the first republic related net income that weve printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we dont think that that first republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate some of the same dynamics that weve just talked about in particular overearning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins also apply to the first republic franchise to some degree so we would expect that to normalize and probably more significantly as the things you alluded to we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition so thats a shortterm tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters and yeah in terms of how its going overall and deepening the relationships that remains a focus and i think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing and yeah i think as i said on the press call things are going well arguably a little bit better than wed sort of modeled as part of the acquisition and were happy to see that', 'okay thank you very much operator thank you there are no further questions jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorgan chase  co thank you very much operator thank you

corporate client segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients access to receptive capital markets in multifamily while we are seeing

compared with a net loss of  million in the prior year predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter expenses of  million were down  million yearonyear to finish up lets turn to the outlook on page  we now expect  nii ex markets to be approximately  billion and total nii to be approximately  billion our outlook for adjusted expense is now about  billion and given where we are in the year we included on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for nii and adjusted expense and note that the nii numbers imply about  million of markets nii in the fourth quarter on credit we continue to expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be approximately  so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance as we look ahead to the next few quarters we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle', 'hey good morning so jeremy as you highlighted full year nii guidance implies a sizable drop in q nii ex markets about  so can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the  basis point cut and since its related ill just throw out my followup question i realize the forward curve is moving around a lot but since dan brought it up a month ago can you frame how youre thinking about the nii trajectory for  thanks', 'yeah sure jim ill try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability so as we sit here today the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is in fact – that were expecting – is in fact the yield curve so that yield curve has changed a little bit since daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter but not that significantly in terms of deposit balances which is obviously another important factor here in light of the fed starting the cutting cycle it feels to us like right now as i mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer were pretty much in the trough right now as we speak when you look at yieldseeking behavior that has come down quite a bit so thats no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal and then if you look at checking account balances those have been pretty stable for some time which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers so thats kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances and in that context the other relevant point is the cd mix where with the rate cuts coming we expect cd balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the cd mix actually peaking around now and then as we move to wholesale weve actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that its likely that the end of qt will be announced sometime soon thats also a little bit supportive for deposit balances so maybe ill – well i guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year so i guess one thing to say right is that we did have a sequential increase in nii this quarter and as you may recall at investor day i said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that wed hit the trough when that happens so thats essentially exactly what were seeing now but from where we sit now given the yield curve assuming the yield curve materializes obviously we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in nii ex markets but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year at which point the combination of balances card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth obviously were guessing its pretty far out in the future and well give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter but i think that gives you a better framework to work with', 'all right thanks a lot', 'thanks operator thank you thank you next we will go to the line of steven chubak with wolfe research you may proceed', 'hi good morning so jeremy how are you so i do want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that daniel had made recently just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light i believe at the time it was just below  billion if we adjust for the onetimers this year that would suggest a core expense base thats just below  billion so pretty healthy stepup in expenses i know youve always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year', 'sure so good question and i agree with your numbers i agree with the way youve normalized this year for the onetime type of significant items and also where the consensus was when daniel made his comments and while were at it i would also just remind you on the nii comments at the time the consensus for this year was  billion and for next year it was  billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of  billion it was because we felt that decline wasnt big enough that we made the comments that we made so happy to expand more on that but anyway to expenses yeah so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of  billion obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously were always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation but that having been said if you assume  for the sake of argument on that base thats a few billion dollars right out of the gates that were working against so thats one thing the other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so theres a not insignificant amount of annualization you cant quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp but if you were to strip that out you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind the other thing thats worth noting is that we do expect fees and volumerelated businesses to grow next year and so all else being equal that would come with a higher expense loading so when you assemble all of those that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below  billion just seemed light in terms of priorities and investments really nothing has changed like the strategy hasnt changed the strategy hasnt changed and the plans havent changed and were just kind of executing with the same longterm perspective that weve always had i would note that relative to nii obviously were in the third quarter now not the fourth quarter and in the old days we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late february so we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and nii next quarter but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on nii', 'and can i just give you just a view of expense a little bit what you call expenses very often i call investments if you actually go back to investor day youll see that were adding private bankers in asset  wealth management were adding etf in asset  wealth management were adding private bankers in international private banking were growing chase wealth management weve added some branches across the united states of america we think there are huge opportunities for innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technology stuff like that our goal is to gain share and everything we do we get really good returns on it so i look at that these are opportunities for us these are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on and we do get and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things and also ai is going to go up a little bit and i would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time', 'thank you both for the color just a quick followup for me just drilling down into nii it appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the fed into securities we saw the yield expand which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and sofr contraction in the quarter i was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment i know that youve had some aversion to that in the past but do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts', 'yeah sure so on extending duration steve you know this obviously but i just think its important to say that all else equal extending duration doesnt change expected nii if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward right so point one point two the curve remains inverted and so even if you dont believe that the policy rate follows the forwards extending right now is actually a headwind to shortterm nii like that wouldnt be a consideration for us either way but i just think thats worth saying for the broader audience its quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers', ' people have mortgages at  so right', 'yeah now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now a couple things to say so obviously a lot of different versions of duration but one number that we disclose is the ear when the q comes out youll see that that number is a little bit lower itll come down from  billion to about  billion if our current estimates are correct thats for a number of reasons some of which are passive but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit and in the end the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of nii against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side and so right now if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors we certainly could we have the capacity inside the portfolio but for now were comfortable with where we are', 'and the one thing i can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months', 'well said well thank you so much for taking my questions', 'thanks steve operator thank you next we will go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed', 'my first question and thank you very much for answering all the nii questions so far jeremy is just i guess another followup as you can imagine once daniel said what he said on stage in september everyone is trying to figure out the overunder for net interest income next year so maybe a twopart first question the second being inspired by what jamie just said number one nii is expected to be down  sequentially in fourth quarter i think yearoveryear in  consensus has it down  from your new level so it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve jeremy it could be a little bit worse yearoveryear than the fourth quarter sequential rate but that being said as jamie noted we have no idea what the curve is going to look like right its gyrated so much and so as we think about the curve is it better for jpmorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve', 'right okay you threw a curve ball at the end there erika i wasnt expecting that to be the end of your question but let me answer the beginning of your question and then ill also answer the end of your question so we see the current  consensus for nii ex markets to be currently at  billion which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter so were happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us that still looks a little toppy but its definitely in the ballpark now that consists of i already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the nii trough sometime in the middle of the year so you can kind of assemble the parts youve got a fourth quarter run rate youve got some sequential declines youve got a trough in the middle of the year and youve got a rough ballpark for the full year so you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought i mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing but on our current assumptions on the current yield curve and remembering that were in the third quarter now so were doing this kind of early thats what we think', 'can i just say something first of all next time lets just give them the damn number i dont want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what theyre guessing what nii is going to be next year can i just also point out that nii all things being equal is a number but all things are never equal and the yield curve if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth and there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace and i think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model a number in your model and so its going to be less than  billion next year probably not a lot we dont know and we dont know the environment', 'good okay now to your question about the ear so a few things to say in there so as i already mentioned when that comes out itll show a number around  billion a very important thing to say is as you know the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical ear is meaningfully higher than our modeled ear which is what we disclose and the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have in actuality been lower than the modeled deposit betas so as a starting point you have to kind of adjust that ear number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually theres some nuances around how the dollar nondollar sensitivity interact and then theres your question which is a little bit about the frontend versus the backend so what you see is that actually the frontend ear has gotten smaller and most of the ear is now in the backend so its definitely the case that all else being equal a steeper curve is better for us but i think what i would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the frontend so therefore in order to answer your question i would say yes we want a steeper curve but having the fed cut more than whats currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin for the context of next years numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us we remain asset sensitive to fed cuts', 'and if i can ask my second question and jamie i completely understand your frustration and to be fair your longterm shareholders really dont care about whether its  billion or  billion right they care about your return on equity to that end i mean its insane how much capital you generate each quarter  basis points this quarter and so beyond the standard boilerplate questions youre going to get on buyback and organic growth yada yada dividend increases how should we think about jpmorgan deploying this capital i mean the world is generally your oyster right youre dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business and again beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter how should your shareholders think about how youre thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital', 'okay first of all when you say dominant id be very careful on that weve got some very tough competition different in different countries different around the world fintech companies direct lenders and i want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that so our goal is always to serve our clients and when i talk about some of these expenses that is a deployment of capital and its a deployment in a different way if you open branches you initially experience an expense but down the road you need capital to support the deposits same for the innovation economy same for private bankers et cetera if you look at it roughly we have about a minimum  billion of excess capital and for me its not burning a hole in my pocket i look at it as you own the whole company and you cant properly deploy it now it is perfectly reasonable to wait and ive been quite clear that i think the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view in life youve got to take a view sometimes are inflated i dont know if theyre extremely inflated or a little bit but i prefer to wait we will be able to deploy it our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting and same thing with deploying capital we can go buy  billion  mortgages increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow we dont make decisions like that the most important thing we do is serve our clients well build the technology and do things like that and we also dont know what the real excess capital is yet so were a little patient were going to be a little patient and wait and itll be fine and so thats where we are and thats not going to change and if it changes well let you know we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do because we think well have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point markets do not stay high forever', 'one last thing cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world and you see my friend warren buffett stockpiling cash right now i mean people should be a little more thoughtful about how were trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed', 'hi thanks very much and so glad jamie didnt say what he was about to say because thats the answer to this question so weve seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers weve seen limited loan growth for a few years now marketrelated also limited flows into fixed income funds yet plenty of growth in private credit in general and youre one of the best asset managers on the planet but in my view less dominant in all things private credit so maybe you could talk about what things youre working on and why thats too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients lending needs not just the public markets and public lending side thanks', 'yeah so let me take time to cover this one because obviously it has become very important people talking about how theyre growing and partnering and things like that and so first and foremost – im going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical i think theyre both important first and foremost we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them therefore when a client comes in we will offer them both direct lending ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending and they all have pluses and minuses direct lending could be done faster maybe simpler covenants unitranche it is more expensive and youre just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending but were going to offer the clients basically whats in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue we mentioned before in the past that we allocated  billion of capital to make direct loans weve actually deployed a lot of capital some of those have already been paid off some of its done so we are going to do it directly and we are going to –  billion could be  billion or  billion not limiting it today i will say today were extending we will do  million we will do  billion we will do more than  billion well do it solehanded or well do it with partners very importantly we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner so we have – i think weve announced a bunch of colenders but that just creates more flexibility and more size were not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody because like i said jpmorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact and were going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that again all in the service of the client and making sure were offering them the best thing and were going with different strategies were not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider i think that would limit what we could offer our clients it probably would be more price competitive we could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the thirdparty capital provider thats our strategy were going to be there were going to do it and were going to do it in spite of the fact theres capital arbitrage taking place so if you look at the arbitrage today where a bank has to hold for things where insurance could they are dramatically different thats a disadvantage but weve had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time we are going to do whats right for the client remember when we do business with a client we also get other revenues off of them so it isnt just the loan we look at the whole relationship so were quite comfortable we can compete i just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that so i hope if any of the press is on they heard this too', 'all right thanks for all that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open', 'good morning jeremy and good morning jamie jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios they are obviously very healthy can you guys give us some color on the new basel iii we dont know what the specifics are but as vice chair barr touched on some of the specifics it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal how are you guys thinking about that do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today', 'yeah when i said were at  billion of excess that is assuming barrs speech that the  goes to  or whatever it is more itll be more than that because there are other factors involved now i was just giving the minimum of excess capital in my view it would be more but it is what it is and well wait to see the final numbers', 'but gerard just maybe to give you a bit of color so yeah obviously everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech it was an important speech but in the end we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff and so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate i note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech but i do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that thats like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable and i would remind you which you obviously know that before this proposal came out it was our position strongly felt that our thenprevailing capital requirements were if anything already more than we needed so weve got a long way to go here and i think our position which jamie has been articulating very consistently is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work and importantly do it holistically so its not just rwa its rwa its gsib its scb its ccar so thats really what we feel strongly about', 'we just want the numbers to be done right and justified if they had to go up we would be fine with that too we just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit what it does to the economy where it pushes lending and things like that so were anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail because thats whats going to make all the difference', 'very good and then as a followup in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a riskweighted asset basis you put it in your presentation of course  trillion average loans is  trillion when the dust settles you know what your capital requirements are can you frame out for us levering up the excess capital with more loans is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis i know youre going to grow your loans but im talking about the mix', 'absolutely positively not loans are an outcome of doing good business we want to do good business if it grows our balance sheet were fine', 'and i do think gerard it depends a lot on what type of loans youre talking about right so i think in the end as jamie says like its capital were going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship what were getting other revenue as part of that so its the same strategy that weve always had but i wouldnt think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product i would think of it as its there for a rainy day lets hope the environment doesnt deteriorate a lot but if it does well be ready and there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock and if not well return it but not now', 'very good appreciate the color and candor as always thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may proceed', 'good morning so lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines obviously we just had one cut and its early but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again conversion of the banking pipelines', 'i would say matt generally no frankly with a couple of minor exceptions so i think its probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree as i mentioned driven by dcm as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some ma transactions and i do think that some of that dcm outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that arent in our pipeline and those are often driven by treasurers and cfos sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those so its possible that thats a little bit of a consequence of the cuts as i think i mentioned we did see for example a pickup in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pickup in refi and our multifamily lending business there might be some hints of more activity there but these cuts were very heavily priced right the curve has been inverted for a long time so to a large degree this is expected so its not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions and thats not really what were seeing', 'yeah and also in the debt markets rates came down spreads are quite low and markets are wide open so it kind of makes sense that people are taking advantage of that today those conditions may not prevail be the ongoing conditions late next year', 'and then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out you had nice growth yearoveryear up  flat quarterover quarter i know theres a lot of seasonality q to q i think last year it was up about  but are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter thank you', 'so i think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because whats happened is that its become normal so meaning – i mean i think were getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic but maybe one last time one of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into te as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadnt done before and everyone was going out to dinner a lot whatever so you had the big spike in te the big rotation into discretionary spending and thats now normalized and you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment but given the levels that it started from what we see it as is actually like normalization and inside that data were not seeing weakening for example in retail spending so overall we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of nolanding scenario economically but obviously as we always point out thats one scenario and there are many other scenarios', 'got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hey jamie i think ive seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career and the august  oped washington post davos youre talking about government i think it was this week or last week on bloomberg youre saying bank mergers should be allowed your bus tour in august you were asked which is my question now under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was “i love what i do” we get it you love what you do but under what circumstances would you consider government service it seems like youd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that youve made is that right wrong whats your thinking', 'i think its wrong ive always been an american patriot my country is more important to me than my company and i think this government is very important to get this – and if you look at the world today mike it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world im not just talking about the american economy and we try to participate in policy at the local level at the state level at the federal level at the international level to try to help thats our job we try to grow economies and things like that so nothing has changed in my view my opinion or my interest i just think its very very important that we try to help the government do a good job', 'so if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country would you be open to considering it', 'i think the chance of that is almost nil and i probably am not going to do it but ive always reserved the right i dont make promise to people i dont have to but no i love what i do i intend to be doing what im doing i almost guarantee ill be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out', 'let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving the other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years youre saying the stock is overvalued and i think thats what youre saying youre saying the stock market is overvalued and therefore all stocks are overvalued and on the one hand you guys you highlight on this call ai tech market share gains high returns high capital so do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price and your ability to do buybacks youre thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more techoriented firms especially as it relates to your progress with ai', 'listen youre making a very good point which is i think we have an exceptional company exceptional franchises and the price point at which you might buy the stock but im not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values and so im just – were just quite patient in that and i think youre going to have to judge us over time about whether were done the right thing to do nothing and remember we could always do it we havent lost the money it didnt go away its sitting in store the only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up weve got to buy at much higher prices and i just i would be a real skeptic about that happening operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open', 'yeah good morning i guess just wanted to followup you talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending another area i would appreciate if you can address is weve been hearing a lot about the likes of jane street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading is that a real risk and is there an opportunity for a firm like jpmorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of ficc activity', 'yeah ebrahim the way i would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality weve always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment and that applies to – and that competitive environment isnt limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions it extends in the consumer space to fintechs and in the market making space it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that youre referring to now those firms are in many cases also clients and thats the same type of dynamic that you see for example in the private credit space that weve discussed before so theres no question that the ecosystem is changing youve got new competitors youve got changes in market structure new dynamics and as with any business we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that were prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways of course there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that and one of the arguments that weve made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of us capital markets ecosystem which is the end view of the world its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts and a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested and its unclear why you would want that and weve cautioned that if thats the intent of the regulations it should be intentional and wellstudied but in the meantime were going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set', 'the previous answer on the private markets it remains to be seen how that develops there is a little bit of that and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets in some ways were wellpositioned for that too because for that you need liquidity marketmaking valuation buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity so that hasnt developed yet but we may have competition but well be there when the time comes and the second one is the public markets you have seen reports about you have deal inventories both corporate and treasuries and i do think thats capital but again we do it remember for clients so we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account and so they are both competition from our standpoint but were there were going to do it were can always deploy more capital if we want and we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients so were very conscious of it there will be competition both sides as jeremy said we sat here  years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that and so far we have', 'got it and just one quick one and jeremy you i think mentioned qt stopping at some point we saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of september give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into yearend and do you have a view on how quickly fed should recalibrate qt or actually stop qt to prevent some loss thanks', 'yeah its a good question ebrahim but i think youve kind of answered your own question in other words like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves thats been heavily speculated about and recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures and side point its just another reason why its important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago you dont want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isnt more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions albeit this one was relatively minor but in any case when you put all that together it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe qt should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that thats going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter so my only point was if you play that view through its a residual headwind for systemwide deposit growth which gets removed and thats one of the reasons that we feel that were probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of', 'so i just want to add a couple policy things here im not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there partially driven by qe and also look at the volatility its not a risk to jpmorgan its a risk to the system and what banks have i already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit so the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets and is it a good policy thing that every time that happens because you can do it very safely fully collateralized all things like that providing what i call flexible financing in the marketplace that that happens the fed has to step in every time i think that becomes a policy issue that every time theres some kind of fluctuation in the market people panic and the fed has got to step in and provide stuff and can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward so i think youve got to be very thoughtful about this and thats why we do think they should look at calibrating slr and eclr and cet all of these things particularly for this so my view is it is going to happen again i cant tell you exactly when but id be surprised if it doesnt happen again', 'got it thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is open', 'oh hi good morning', 'can you hear me hello', 'can you hear me okay', 'yeah we can hear you can you hear us', 'oh yes thank you so one for jeremy one for jamie jeremy and jamie sorry about the nii question im going to have but it is more than half your revenue so i kind of care about it but when im thinking about the trough and then the buildup qt ending deposit growth i mean thats part of the calculation for improvement as we go into  right i should embed that outlook is that right and thats embedded in how youre thinking about it i know we dont have a number for you for nii for  but it is in there right', 'yeah in other words it goes back to my prior point and to the point that i had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular –', 'right', '– that theres lots of different offsetting factors right now right youve got the yield curve youve got card revolve youve got balances and balances have been a headwind we now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year and one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of qt but emphasize the word potential to jamies point you also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset fixedrate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit while were on nii just to annoy jamie a little bit more i do want to make a point that i didnt get a chance to make previously which is theres a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the markets nii in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it it gives you a launch point run rate which is significantly higher than whats currently in the consensus and obviously what weve seen this year and ill give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in markets nii are almost always bottomline neutral and offset in nir but for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models i would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is the number of cuts that are in the curve the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liabilitysensitive so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean again shouldnt change the overall revenue expectation its just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models i wanted to make that point', 'and so daniels comments in september were on nii in total or nii ex markets could you just clarify that', 'no those were core nii or nii ex so again reiterating at the time the  consensus was  billion the  consensus was  billion on nii ex and our point was that that number which remains an assetsensitive number indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline yearonyear the current consensus as we see it for nii ex markets is  billion and as weve noted thats closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy', 'okay then one for jamie jamie we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have capital in store just wanted to understand how youre thinking about that opportunity set thats in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions i realize that depositories are not on the docket but we all know theres portfolios out there that might be looking for a home and could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage', 'yeah so asset acquisitions i mean i always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things but if you listen to what im saying about my caution about the world its hard for me to say that were going to be in the market to buy credit assets', 'what about loans the apple card…', 'but creating those assets to help clients thats a whole different matter because when it comes to clients we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff if our bankers can deploy capital that way of course be that we want to do more and our cio could deploy capital in multiple ways we would probably do more and we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing can we do more in things were actually quite comfortable and yeah if we could find ways to deploy capital we would be happy to do that but put us in your closest category', 'and what about like a private label credit card for example', 'indiscernible', 'im just wondering about private label credit card for example is that something that would help clients jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer jpmorgan chase  co almost no chance', 'well but having – its very important while i say that i always tell the management team secondguess me i mean weve done private label i know what it is weve been there i have a lot of issues with it but is it possible its going to be different one day and a different thing yeah its possible so i dont want to cut it off if marianne lake says to me jamie i think clearly the worlds changed were going to change but right now wed say no theres no chance', 'thank you so much operator thank you our final question will come from saul martinez with hsbc your line is open', 'hey good morning im not going to ask about a specific nii in  but i did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the ccb over the next few years you have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin  down about  basis points as deposit balances have come down so it put some pressure on deposit nii but deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going so i guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down say to the level that are consistent with the forward curve i know the forward curve is likely going to be long but thats the reference point we have and conversely volume offset you mentioned jeremy the retail deposits becoming a tailwind but i guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits so just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit the value of the deposit franchise', 'sure yeah thanks for the question saul and i think youve laid out the building blocks there already just for simplicity im going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed ccb deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the ccb deposits and the internal ftp into that and that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things so i think its actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors and i think when you do that what you see is weve been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weightedaverage rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high and that was going to have to correct one way or the other either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings andor we were going to see a ton of internal migration ie growth in the cd mix andor we would see a lower policy rate so as we sit here right now of course we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy we were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin weve leaned in heavily to cds and gotten to the current level of cd mix and thats been a good strategy and from where we sit now we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down it seems that that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective we think the cd mix has probably peaked now on the way down its not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle thats an important thing to realize so all else equal that creates a little bit of margin compression and then through all of that obviously a lower yield environment should mean that theres a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits as i mentioned were seeing a lot less yieldseeking behavior so then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned which is our longterm share growth in ccb deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top  markets in ccb are at that  share number so we believe theres big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of  basis points or ', 'basis points that weve seen historically thats how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer', 'jeremy correct me if you think im wrong the abnormal time period was when rates were between  and  or  other than that if youre looking at say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business forget people going after really hot money if that happens its  to ', 'absolutely yeah we agree', 'okay thats helpful so it sounds like youre a little bit above that but theres still some pressure but youre not dramatically above those levels', 'very good returns in business in both banking  wealth management were growing market share and when we build branches and stuff like that we dont necessarily assume current margins we look at what would be normal margins over time and were very comfortable doing very nice business for you all', 'yes got it okay thats helpful thanks a lot thats all i got jeremy barnum chief financial

the disclaimer in the back starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion and delivered an rotce of  these results included the  billion fdic special assessment and  million of net investment securities losses in corporate on page  we have more on our fourth quarter results similar to prior quarters we have called out the impact of first republic where relevant youll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits which were previously in ccb to the appropriate lines of business for the quarter first republic contributed  billion of revenue  million of expense and  million of net income now focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results excluding first republic revenue of  billion was up  billion or  yearonyear nii ex markets was up  billion or  predominantly driven by higher rates nir ex markets was up  million or  and markets revenue was up  million or  expenses of  billion were up  billion or  yearonyear predominantly driven by the fdic special assessment and higher compensation including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology and credit costs were  billion reflecting net chargeoffs of  billion and a net reserve build of  million net chargeoffs were up  billion predominantly driven by card and single name exposures in wholesale which were largely previously reserved the net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the commercial bank looking at the full year results on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  and revenue of  billion and we delivered an rotce of  on to balance sheet and capital on page  we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  up  basis points versus the prior quarter primarily driven by net income oci gains and lower rwa partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed basel iii endgame requirements now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page  total debit and credit card spend was up  yearonyear driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable turning now to the financial results excluding first republic ccb reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion which was up  yearonyear in banking  wealth management revenue was up  yearonyear reflecting higher nii on higher rates largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down  yearonyear client investment assets were up  driven by market performance and strong net inflows – in fact its been a record year for retail net new money in home lending revenue was up  million predominantly driven by the absence of an msr loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher nii moving to card services  auto – revenue was up  yearonyear driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up  due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were  billion up  as we gained market share while retaining strong margins expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by compensation including an increase in employees primarily in bankers advisors and technology and wage inflation as well as continued investments in marketing and technology in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were  billion largely driven by net chargeoffs which were up  million yearonyear predominantly due to continued normalization in card the net reserve build of  million reflected loan growth in card next the cib on page  the cib reported net income of  billion on revenue of  billion investment banking revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear ib fees were also up  yearonyear and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of  in advisory fees were up  underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prioryear quarter with debt up  and equity up  we are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity but announced ma remains a headwind and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain payments revenue was  billion up  yearonyear excluding equity investments it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by depositrelated client credits moving to markets total revenue was  billion up  yearonyear fixed income was a record fourth quarter up  it was another strong quarter in our securitized products business which was partially offset by lower revenue in rates coming off a strong quarter last year equity markets was down  driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash securities services revenue of  billion was up  year onyear expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear predominantly driven by the timing of revenuerelated compensation credit costs were  million reflecting net chargeoffs of  million and a net reserve build of  million moving to the commercial bank on page  commercial banking reported net income of  billion revenue of  billion was up  year onyear largely driven by higher nii where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances payments revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by fee growth largely offset by depositrelated client credits gross investment banking and markets revenue of  million was up  yearonyear primarily reflecting increased capital markets and ma activity expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear driven by an increase in employees including front office and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense including the impact of new client acquisition average deposits were down  yearonyear primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarteronquarter as client balances are seasonally higher at yearend loans were down  quarteronquarter ci loans were down  reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious and cre loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity finally credit costs were  million including net chargeoffs of  million and a net reserve build of  million driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook and then to complete our lines of business awm on page  asset  wealth management reported net income of  million – with pretax margin of  revenue of  billion was up  yearonyear driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels predominantly offset by lower nii the decrease in nii reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans expenses of  billion were up  yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation including performancebased incentives continued growth in our private banking advisor teams the impact of closing jp morgan asset management china acquisition and the continued investment in global shares for the quarter net longterm inflows were  billion – positive across equities and fixed income – and  billion for the full year in liquidity we saw net inflows of  billion for the quarter and net inflows of  billion for the full year and we had record client asset net inflows  billion for the year aum of  trillion and client assets of  trillion were both up  yearonyear driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels and finally loans were up  quarteronquarter and deposits were up  quarteronquarter turning to corporate on page  corporate reported a net loss of  million revenue of  billion was up  million yearonyear nii of  billion was up  billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix nir was a net loss of  million compared with a net loss of  million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront and expenses of  billion were up  billion yearonyear predominantly driven by the fdic special assessment with that lets pivot to the outlook for  starting with nii on page  we expect  nii ex markets to be approximately  billion going through the drivers the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve which currently includes six cuts this year on deposits we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels while lower rates should decrease repricing pressure we remain asset sensitive and therefore lower rates will decrease nii resulting in more normal deposit margins we expect strong loan growth in card to continue but not at the same pace as  still this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates outside of card loan growth will likely remain muted its important to note that we just reported a quarterly nii ex markets run rate of  billion combining that with the full year guidance of approximately  billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout  consistent with what weve been telling you for some time and keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that weve highlighted previously surrounding the nii outlook remain and on total nii we expect it to be approximately  billion for the full year reflecting an increase in markets nii which as always you should think of as largely offset in nir now lets turn to expenses on page  we expect  adjusted expense to be about  billion youll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business generally you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are both in terms of share and available returns and of course youll hear more at investor day and between now and then on the righthand side of the page weve highlighted some firmwide drivers thematically the biggest driver is what i might call business growth writ large within that narrowly defined volume and revenuerelated growth represents about  billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved nir outlook compared to about  million in  but in addition the ongoing growth of the company which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability is coming with increased expense across a range of categories the quantum of investment increase is comparable to last years increase and is driven by all the same themes bankers branches advisors technology as well as marketing net net first republic produces a modest increase in expenses but with a significantly lower  exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts finally despite significantly lower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories its worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during  and to support the future growth and profitability of the company weve included the fourth quarter  exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the yearonyear increase in expense is already in the run rate now lets turn to page  and cover credit and wrap up on credit we continue to expect the  card net chargeoff rate to be below  consistent with investor day guidance so in closing we shouldnt leave  without noting what an outstanding year it was producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items were very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible at the same time we emphasized throughout  the extent to which we were overearning as indicated by an rotce that is  above our throughthecycle target as we turn to  it shouldnt be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns but despite the expected dissipation of the  tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties we remain optimistic about this franchises ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments and this management team remains laserfocused on executing for shareholders clients and communities', 'good morning thanks for all the comments on the net interest income any updates on that medium term outlook that youve put out there', 'yeah matt not particularly updating i think youre referring to that  billion number that wed put out there and i wouldnt exactly describe that as an outlook i think its more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning so not particularly necessary to revise the number but i just would point out again as we highlight on the page and as i highlighted in the prepared remarks that when you look at that  billion exit rate and full year guidance of  billion that implies obviously exiting below  billion and some significant sequential decline so in that sense you can see us kind of marching on the path to that  billion whether we ever get to the  billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year', 'okay and then just separately you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter whats your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals', 'yeah good question and i think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation so the normal capital hierarchy will apply but for now we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of  billion net buyback a quarter number that weve talked about and that youve seen us do in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer as you said the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules and also just as a reminder the scb is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile so thats another factor that we need to keep in mind', 'thanks matt operator next well go to the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research you may proceed', 'thanks jeremy could you give a little more color on whats baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter', 'yeah actually john this quarter thats all like pretty quiet so the weighted average unemployment rate number is still  we didnt have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of  and whats in our central outlook which i think is something like  sic  peak of the current levels', 'okay and then just to follow up on the nii could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of fed cuts like whats the impact of a few fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if youre thinking four five six i know its complicated but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful', 'sure yeah happy to do that john so i think probably the best way to do this is to look at our ear numbers so as you know we dont update that until the q but on an estimated basis its going to be a little bit lower so i think something like  billion as opposed to  billion so just round numbers about  billion in ear i think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the ear weve been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger but just crudely i think as i noted we do remain assetsensitive thats one way to quantify it i would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that and hopefully that gives you enough to work with', 'okay thanks operator next well go to the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed', 'hey good morning maybe just to follow up in a different way on the nii question just in deposits can you jeremy discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts and then layering in if we do get six cuts does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits how are you thinking about all that', 'yeah both good questions so lets do reprice first so i think all else equal this more dovish fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice especially productlevel reprice at the same time we do continue to expect internal migration particularly out of checking and savings into cds and in wholesale a little bit of ongoing migration out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing and that trajectory i would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment so as a result if you look at weighted average rate paid for example for the consumer deposit franchise we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts and thats actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into cds but maybe a little nonintuitive if youre kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid it gets a little bit nonintuitive and then in terms of balances yeah youll note that i said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down which when you consider the qt despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted its a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates so i kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin a little bit more supportive for systemwide deposit balances and then obviously we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses', 'right okay thanks a lot operator next well go to the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed', 'hey good morning i guess maybe one question looking at your statement and i think jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing i would love to hear – im not sure jamies on the call – but maybe jeremy i would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased is the market pricing in correctly or when you look at your customer base are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes', 'right okay ebrahim so i think a lot of those things arent actually mutually exclusive so statement one i think its uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing thats i think the consensus at this point so whether you believe it or not is a separate issue but i think that is the consensus in terms of consumer resilience i made some comments about this on the press call the way we see it the consumer is fine all of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized and the question really in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal but that that means that consumers have been spending more than theyre taking in is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were', 'so one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take but i do think its important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view just in the central case modeling – obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market and a very strong labor market means all else equal strong consumer credit so thats how we see the world', 'and maybe just taking that a step further there has been concern around whether we see some of the cre pain filter into multifamily apartments you all have a pretty large multifamily exposure high quality but just give us a sense of one are you seeing any bleedthrough of what weve seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of ci lending thank you', 'yeah so good question on the multifamily and the short answer is that for us its pretty uncontroversially no – no bleedthrough and the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily thats in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in so its higherend stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure and as you know our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable supply constrained markets and so the performance there remains really very robust', 'got it thank you  operator next well go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed', 'hi good morning my first question is a followup on matts with regarding the buyback you printed  cet in the quarter on a net basis net of rwa growth your net income produces  basis points every quarter again thats net of rwa growth im wondering what guideposts youre looking for jeremy in terms of that buyback increasing from that  billion a quarter do we need to wait for basel iii finalization which seems like it could be quite delayed or will having clarity in the june dfast results – you mentioned the scb – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term', 'yeah erika thats a good question and i understand what youre asking – why youre asking it i think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying which is that this is classic decisionmaking under uncertainty and its kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors but all the ingredients that youve listed are the right ingredients right very strong organic capital generation uncertainty about the finalization of the rule uncertainty about the scb requirements and obviously our normal capital hierarchy which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after were done using the capital for our other priorities so i think what i said previously stands which is that were sticking with the modest pace for now but obviously we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime and we may well do that', 'thanks and just as a followup the  billion in expenses for  does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for ', 'a little bit of that is in there yeah so you would see that we often talk about the volume in revenue related category and i think in my prepared remarks you will have noted that i talked about a  billion increase in that category yearonyear as a result of an improved nir outlook so the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that', 'thank you operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hi so youre guiding to  billion of expenses thats up  billion yearoveryear seems like quite a big increase and if you could just give some color on that i know weve been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility so if you could just upfront give us visibility how much of that is due to incentive pay how much is that due to tech how much is that due to ai and what are the expected returns to get from that  billion pickup thanks', 'yeah mike thanks for the question and yeah – and of course you will as i noted be hearing more from us at investor day and between now and investor day but i will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because youre right its important to give you the transparency and im going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business so starting with ccb its the biggest dollar driver overall its an  increase yearonyear which is about the same as we had last year one key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that in  we built  new branches and were planning about a similar number this year marketing is also a driver were seeing great opportunities great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing and as you well know our wealth strategy in ccb remains a big focus and priority i think its worth noting here right that as weve talked about and as you know mike some of our investments are designed to produce short term payoffs and some of them are much longerterm and some of them are just table stakes but we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the ccb investment so for example in  we had  million net new checking accounts we had an  growth in active card accounts and over the last three years weve increased deposit market share by  basis points so as weve often said about the company as a whole were very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future in awm continued client advisor hiring is a key driver as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need and a little bit to the prior question in awm we also have a little bit of volume and revenuerelated driver tied to an improved revenue outlook the commercial bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy so we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise and then as you look into  its really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally the cib story is a little bit different the percentage growth there is lower which recognizes i think both our very very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that weve been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains so as a result the biggest driver in the cib is really generic inflation including labor as well as again to the prior question volume and revenuerelated increases tied to the improved nir outlook and i do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that were upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the cib remains fully in effect', 'finally youll note that i havent actually talked about technology in any of the businesses and thats actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm even though its very bottomsup driven and those drivers are consistent with what theyve been new products features and customer platforms as well as modernization so thats happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise and i will say actually in closing talking about technology – which i think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large one of the things that we see is higher volumerelated technology expense throughout the company so thanks for the question mike it was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here', 'yeah can you just talk about the impact of ai on your technology approach and i know ive asked you this before and you said youre spending it youre being careful you want to see a return on your dollars but how much difference can this make how big is your tech budget last year how much should it be this year how much could ai make a difference just a little more meat on the tech bones', 'yeah sure so let me address the ai point and i think maybe i wont go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and ill save that for investor day if you dont mind but i will address the ai point so as you may be aware we actually have teresa heitsenrether now running the ai strategy for the company as a member of the operating committee which i think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with lori and all of the technology organization so i think that – i think of this as being a little bit barbelled where on the one hand were very excited about this theres clearly some very significant opportunities not for nothing starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there at the same time were jpmorgan chase were not going to be chasing shiny objects here in ai we want to do this in an extremely disciplined way its very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes and so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained wellchosen list of highimpact use cases and that were throwing resources at those in the right way thats extremely pragmatic and disciplined and were holding ourselves accountable for actual results', 'all right thank you', 'thanks mike operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets you may proceed', 'hi jeremy how are you', 'jeremy coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming can you give us a little insight why youre assuming six cuts is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker or is it your just economic outlook the forward curve can you give us something behind why youre assuming so many rate cuts', 'yeah gerard i wish the answer were more interesting but its just our practice we just always use the forward curve for our outlook and thats whats in there', 'okay very good and then as a followup obviously you pointed out also in the outlook youre going to have some deposit attrition you had some of course in  can you guys give us some insights on the impact qt is having on the deposit base for your organization and second are you surprised that qt hasnt been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets', 'yeah good question gerard i mean i think youve heard jamie talk about this a lot qt is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment i think that the math is the math in the sense that qt all else equal is withdrawing from systemwide deposits in the last six months of this year thats been offset hopefully by a reduction in the size of rrp and so thats been supportive of systemwide deposits as we go into  rrp is at lower levels and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind but its also the case as you know that theres – the markets expectation is that qt is going to start slowing down at some point this year so – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from rrp so thats part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share but also i think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the fed does', 'thanks gerard operator next well go to the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley you may proceed', 'hey good morning thanks for taking my questions there has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound you noted youre starting the year with a healthy pipeline could you give us some more color on what youre seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that youre having across ma ecm and dcm', 'yeah sure so as you know all else equal this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets so if you go into the details a little bit if you start with ecm that helps higher and – well the recent rally in the equity markets helps i think thereve been some modest challenges with the  ipo vintage in terms of postlaunch performance or whatever so thats a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline but im not too concerned about that in general so i would expect to see rebound there in dcm again all else equal lower rates are clearly supportive one of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates so that can go both ways and then ma is a slightly different dynamic i think theres a couple nuances there one as you obviously know announced volume was lower this year so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in  all else equal and of course we are in an environment of ma regulatory headwinds as has been heavily discussed but having said that i think were seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and i would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive', 'great and on the flip side in ci you spoke about lower revolver utilization more muted demand what would it take for that to rebound do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more', 'yeah its a good question i mean i think as you say its a little bit of a – i mean i wouldnt necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization i think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the csuite which increases as the companies get smaller in size so its really going to be a function of how  plays out the softer the landing is the more supported the utilization should be i would think if things turn out a little bit worse i think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about capex and so on and so you might see utilization even lower', 'hi thank you so i want to get your perspective on private credit overall the industry saw a lot of growth but its only so big relative to the banking market i think theres been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending but now youre starting to see more in assetbacked finance and youre seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy so my question to you is how big of a trend is this how much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular and most importantly how does jpmorgan adapt and participate', 'yeah thanks glenn so i think the last part of your question as you say is the most important part which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company so it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that weve been watching for some time weve made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses but also go headtohead with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures if and when thats what the client actually wants it tends to be a tradeoff between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong longtime dcm franchise so thats been a priority and were actually already starting to see some results from that across both the commercial bank and the cib with certain client segments and in the bigger picture of course in the context of the basel iii endgame people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter its important to be clear right these are important clients of ours too we compete with them theyre also clients and in the end our point here is just people and regulators in particular should just be aware of the likely consequences of whats happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that were looking around the corner a little bit', 'anything specific on assetbacked its an important part of your business too do you see it following the same path as direct lending has', 'its interesting i havent heard much about that glenn so we can look into it for you but to be honest the fact that i havent heard much makes me think that its maybe not such a big driver right now', 'okay cool thank you for that operator and for our final question well go to the line of charles peabody from portales partners you may proceed', 'thank you i have a question about the role that first republic plays in your nii forecast im assuming because youll have a full year in  of first republic that their contribution of nii will be up lets say from  billion this year to  billion to  billion next year but given that youre forecasting six rate cuts is that a detractor to your assumptions of nii from first republic or – i mean you have that fdic note and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that i assume are repricing upwards so if youre talking about rate cuts that would hurt your nii forecast from first republic im guessing but if rates stay higher for longer wouldnt first republic be a much bigger contributor so talk about the sensitivities of first republic there', 'yeah thanks charlie so one thing that we said when we kind of gave first republic guidance at investor day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that and weve been splitting out first republic in our reported results in order to improve periodonperiod', 'comparability we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on first republic and so we really focused on having our guidance be firmwide including first republic now that everything is embedded in the franchise having said that let me just react to a couple of the things that you said so again i dont want to get into like microvalidation one way or the other of some of your backoftheenvelope math but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year so i think the annualization that youre doing is maybe a bit high for the  number and then from a sensitivities perspective i actually think i can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the ear per my response to the prior question because that ear fully includes all of the first republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics and so i think thats kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company', 'just to make sure i understood what youre saying so you have nii ex markets going from  billion to  billion within that would the contribution from first republic be down as well or up', 'its going to hit… the day we did it so', 'yeah i mean i can probably answer that question if i think about it for a second but it sort of violates my prior statement that i really dont want to get into the business of guiding on first republic if i do the big picture right so big picture  we had eight months of first republic nii  were going to have  so all else equal theres calendarization in there whats also true is that in  as a result of the impact of the nii of the pull to par of certain relatively shortdated assets that we fairvalued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juiced the  number a little bit so therefore straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it then you just get into the questions about the ftp and the funding and whatever and then this is like too complicated so id rather not go there', 'all right thank you operator and we do have no further questions at this time jeremy

is not leaving the company yet so its a bit premature what im about to do i just wanted to say and id be remiss not to say he was a young man who joined the company at  years old in argentina he ran trading in argentina then he ran trading for latin america then he ran global emerging markets trading then he ran fixed income trading and then became cohead of the investment bank and then sole head of the investment bank for  years over that whole time helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world and then obviously was president for five years or more a great partner of mine trusted by everyone at the company so were thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward but i just wanted to recognize the contributions he made', 'hi good morning jeremy i wanted to ask about capital and i know you get this question a lot about the kind of highclass dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store so i guess whats the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities', '', 'welcome back john read your piece the other day it took me quite a while but it was good work john mcdonald analyst truist securities inc thanks', '', 'so yeah youve noted all the points that we always make so i wont repeat them and i think the way were thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment we believe theres a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest and so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us having said that having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect weve concluded that we do have enough we have enough excess and given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here so when you think about the implications of that given the amount of organic capital generation that were producing it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise it means more capital return through buybacks all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of the excess and that is our current plan although ill give the caveat that as you know is in our disclosure which is we dont want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason but that is our current thinking', 'okay thanks jeremy and then just as a followup when we think about the investment spend agenda this year how does it differ from say last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum youve talked about and then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well thanks', 'sure the truth is – and i guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent so we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main areas of focus the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the commercial  investment bank we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and thats embedded in the culture of the company so we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that but broadly the themes are very consistent i think in terms of efficiency a couple of things to say which you know well one is when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company its organic its bau its evergreen it happens every day in all the teams everywhere and so that is sort of part of the bottoms up culture and that remains the case we do have a few topdown areas of focus i think if i go for example into technology for starters were putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and theres been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive and so all else equal that generates a little bit of efficiency we also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization and so thats embedded in there as well and another thing thats worth noting youll recall that at investor day i talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend as jamie always says were always modernizing so the fact that weve gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means were going to be constantly modernizing but at the margin that means that inside the tech teams theres a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on which is also in some sense a form of efficiency', 'finally though what i would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently but any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth you have to believe all else equal that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced and so this year as we went through the budget cycle we ask people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front so were going to try to run things with some important exceptions that ill highlight in a second on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and we consider more efficient ways of doing things the obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth so obviously branches and bankers and so on and also critical nonnegotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that were running the company safely so thats how were thinking about efficiency in the current moment john mcdonald analyst truist securities inc very helpful thank you', '', 'efficiently said operator thank you next we will go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed', 'hi simple and then more difficult i guess jamie whos your successor and then the second question is i know i asked the question at investor day why not stay as ceo a little bit longer i think what im hearing from investors now it goes up and down but i think investors would like you to stay so why say youre going to stay less than five years youre finally getting what you wanted  years your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs and it seems like youre finally getting what youve been playing for so why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so and what would you do otherwise anyway you dont play golf you arent going to be treasury secretary seems like your work is your hobby right so how much longer would you stay around', 'i do love what i do and answering the second question first look were on a path the path is not just about me its about the other senior people in the company its about the board if im here for several more years and i may or may not be chairman thats going to be up to the board does it really fit the new ceo and stuff like that youre talking potentially four five years or more ill be  in march i think its the rational thing to do ive had a couple health problems you know i just think it makes a lot of sense and so – and what was your first question again mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc whos your successor', '', 'oh yeah this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always toing and froing we have several exceptional people you guys know most of them theres maybe one or two you dont know the board reviews and meets with them all the time i think its wonderful that jenn piepszak who does not want to be the ceo will be here as chief operating officer and stay after that so obviously shes going to work with those people which i think is great for a company just having continuity of management and leadership and will be one of those people and obviously were not going to tell the press but its not determined yet and of course the last minute a couple years from now people get sick they change their mind have family circumstances so even if you thought you knew today you couldnt be completely sure mike mayo', '', 'basic case yeah mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you', 'operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global securities you may proceed', 'hey good morning maybe just on regulation we have a new administration coming in we have a new soontobe i guess a new head of regulation at the fed so maybe just talk about again what areas of the regulatory structure if it were to change would be most impactful for you and is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up thanks', 'hey jim i mean its obviously something were thinking about a lot but i could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve and i just dont really think thats productive right now but let me make some attempt to answer your question so backing up a second if you read jamies quotes theyre very consistent with what weve been saying as a company for a long time which is that all we want is a coherent rational holisticallyassessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy that isnt reflexively antibank that doesnt default to the answer to every question being more of', 'everything more capital more liquidity that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth and the hope is that we get some of that and that also while were at it some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin management can focus its time on the things that matter the most so whether capital goes up down stays flat is really so complicated because its not just basel iii endgame its also a gsib its also a number of other factors and thats why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically properly with the right analysis and if that takes time so be it', 'can i just add no thats great jeremy gave it all let me add three quick things liquidity is also equally important theres been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how lcr is done i think is very important second is competition all these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want what kind of private markets you want what do you want in the banking system what you want out of the banking system and the third is i think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the byzantine balkanized system we built which has negatives and even the regulators will tell you that so at one point just take a deep breath as jeremy said lets do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world', 'yeah no that makes sense and maybe just as a followup just on loan growth have you – since the election it seems like ceo confidence business confidence has increased so are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending just any thoughts there would be great', 'yeah its a good question and i think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth we are not really seeing that i dont particularly think thats a negative i think its probably explained by a combination of wideopen capital markets and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution and maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what theyre executing in the nearterm but well see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other and maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other youll actually see that come through ci loan growth in particular jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks', 'operator thank you next we will go to the line of erika najarian from ubs your line is open', 'yes hi good morning wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of jeremy the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator so if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your gsib surcharge score that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a  gsib so obviously from what we understand if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year then your gsib surcharge goes up by – to  or by  basis points two years and one day from now at the same time around the holidays we did get the press release from both the federal reserve and the lawsuit from the banks in terms of the transparency it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this years stress test so as we think about the definition of excess right because part of this is like  is clearly a huge number so as we think about your returns going forward the definition of excess also continues to shift so how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components clearly one is your gsib surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer', 'right erika okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep but lets try and address this not too much great length first of all gsib so yes it was a high print in the third quarter but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter so while our current view of gsib number is an estimate were quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the  bucket just as a result of normal seasonality it was actually a relatively quiet december in terms of the types of yearend things that sometimes create pressures of various types so that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns so not much to see there and the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed gsib rule which is obviously a little bit hung up with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on its not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other but anyway for now were managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under  okay you mentioned the lawsuit i think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the fed that many of the things that weve been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the nonsubstantive bureaucratic burden associated with the ccar process needs improvement so thats great i think i wont speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up so lets just hope that we see some significant progress on that front and then taking a step back at a high level what youre really asking me is what is our core view about and i think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually what is our core view about if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment and the way were increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator up  numerator up  numerator up  numerator i guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerators a little less and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess and as you point out at  and i think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like  billion through pretty much any reasonable lens its a ton of excess which is why weve concluded that it doesnt need to grow anymore', 'and just a followup question – a followup to johns line of questioning as a placeholder as we think about what you said trying to arrest the growth of cet for now should we just assume that anything that you dont need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that  will be bought back by the company as we think about i know you dont want to predict the buyback but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase', 'yeah youve quoted our capital hierarchy and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess', 'so we are never going to tell the market what were going to do you all know that everybody is out there modeling these things trading against these things so steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake operator does that conclude your question erika', 'very good we can go to the next question thanks yeah operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open', 'good morning it seems like you guys have backed off the view that youre materially overearning on net interest income and is this all because of the higher rate environment thats expected now or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing specifically on the consumer side which i think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than weve seen', 'yeah its a good question matt i guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives so on the one hand youre right if you look at the nii guidance that were giving you including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards which as we know is the one thing that we know wont happen but if you want to assume something if you assume the forwards were sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year again based on all of our current assumptions all else being equal and you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable i think if you take a big step back by historical standards the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field the current structure of the yield curve is such that for the time being anyway when we do the math thats what we see do we think thats truly truly truly sustainable through the cycle unclear but i guess well cross that bridge when we come to it for now this is the outlook for the coming year', 'and weve gotten closer to normalized nii and normalized credit', 'yeah it is worth noting that nii ex markets is down yearonyear so theres some normalization there', 'okay and then just separately a strategic question theres been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally and i guess i just want to push on that where we really havent seen other banks do it in a successful way obviously your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength leading digitally but i guess im just wondering like is it worth it is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking', 'yeah i think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative and i just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment thats not to say that like were special or anything its just that the strategy is very different and its a very different moment so its a new initiative its obviously not riskfree but its going pretty well and pointing out the obvious if we didnt think it was worth it we wouldnt be doing it but we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision and its one of our strategic initiatives and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you', 'operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning', '', 'guys can you hear me okay all right just want to make sure you can hear me so this has been a great call first congratulations on a great quarter its been a great call with a lot of robust questions here youre like what else is there to ask heres my question as we think about the nii outlook and you highlighted the nim pressure but loan – but basically balance is increasing here right maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers is it qt going away deposits going up punch it into securities is it loan growth inflecting is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year and then lastly as i think about your comments around youve got the green market share number one youve got the yellow youve got the red places maybe we cant see could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are are they just scattered everybody – every single business has one or are there some that have more than others and therefore more opportunities and is it more balance sheet or fee generative thats kind of what id like to just discuss if you have a minute thanks', 'sure yeah let me take a crack at that betsy so loan growth i think looking for areas where it might inflect the only thing i can think of frankly that would be in that category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the companys performance would be acquisition finance because thats been relatively muted as a a function of the ma environment and if that picks up you could see more there now those arent loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long so whether that shows up in fees or nii or whatever its a separate issue but as you can see like on our presentation page for the nii outlook you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind and while that is also a driver of growth in  again based on our current guess about the future it will be – its decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite still growing above trend obviously which is great and its a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that were getting from our card clients but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin so yeah i think a higher growth environment a little bit more optimism could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking could you see a bit more growth in ci at the margin yes but i think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are dealdriven i would say so well see well see what happens there and in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green i think you know them right and theyre aligned with our big longstanding investment strategies the biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table so thats why were pushing so hard on that front because i think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely there are a bunch of examples elsewhere but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business inside investment banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better and as i mentioned we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley  co llc thank you', '', 'thank you betsy operator thank you next we will go to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open', 'good morning i guess just two questions in terms of areas of vulnerability so i heard you jeremy on the lending side but lots of crosscurrents like if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration thats taking place or take office with a focus on domestic capex even if we dont get any rates cut when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability be it because of tariffs be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the fed yeah would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean', 'oh i see where your question is that took me a second yeah i mean look wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict it tends to be very idiosyncratic you obviously know that were coming out of a plus year period of an exceptionally low chargeoff rate and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level a little bit to jamies comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those we do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock a lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that frankly so you can rest assured that were running the relevant analysis but im not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever jamie did you want to add', 'i would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment thats both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side it bleeds into mortgages subprime credit card so really its your forecast of unemployment which you have to make your own which will determine that over time and so the second thing you said vulnerabilities its unemployment but the worst case would be stagflation higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board were not predicting that but you just asked where the vulnerability is thats the vulnerability', 'and i guess – thanks for that just sticking with that as far as qt is concerned when you talk to experts like no one knows where the right level for the fed to end is im just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth', 'yeah i think the conventional wisdom on qt and im not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other is that the tapering should sort of complete and therefore we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year of course they may change that but that seems to be the current market consensus and when we sort of take a step back and look at the h data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff when you look at the way our peers are behaving evolution of qt expectations for economywide loan growth et cetera and what the impact of that might be on the growth of systemwide deposits its kind of consistent with the story that were telling about sort of the background growth in our nii outlook plus or minus what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year ebrahim h poonawala analyst bofa securities inc thank you', 'operator thank you our final question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy', '', 'you mentioned in your comments about the overall firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half you could see some growth and youre very – i think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits we noticed in the industry data from the regulators household checking deposits prepandemic for the industry were running about  trillion now they have remained elevated postpandemic at  trillion can you – based on what youre seeing in your customer base what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits', 'thats fascinating gerard ill have to take a look at that data i dont actually recognize those numbers but i can speak for ourselves which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise its a couple of things so of course there was some excess and there was some yieldseeking behavior so you did see people moving money out of checking into higheryielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle it feels to us as if were in the final innings of that were just not seeing nearly as much yieldseeking pressure as we had seen in the meantime as you well know we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets so the combination of the tailend of the yieldseeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise', 'very good and then as a followup circling back about the capital levels you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be can you share the pros and cons from jpmorgans perspective not so much from an investor but we understand of course you can do a share repurchase obviously you can do nondepository acquisitions with the excess capital but what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of  return on tangible common equity youre growing your income and capital very nicely every year but what are those pros and cons again from jpmorgans perspective', 'yeah so we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back so hell – he wants to go so go ahead', 'no no jeremy go ahead', 'no no no you go seriously', 'i was just going to say were not going to do one we have looked at it if you all have any great insights for us let us know but most people dont want it doesnt add shareholder value and ive never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing i think its a huge mistake to look at life and you have to deploy capital so we want to be very very patient but special dividends if you look at the history of special dividends they really basically dont work', 'if anyone has a different opinion were always interested gerard cassidy', '', 'thanks gerard operator thank you and we have no further questions at this time jamie dimon chairman  chief executive officer

              "'yeah good question jim i think the simplest and best answer to that is not really so as weve been saying for a while migration from checking and savings to cds is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise that continues we continue to capture that moneyinmotion at a very high rate were very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that were seeing im aware that theres a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting weve looked at that data we see some evidence that maybe its slowing a little bit were quite cautious on that we really sort of dont think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  that youre not going to see ongoing migration and frankly we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yieldseeking behavior so its quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues so i would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there'"

Your volume is going up but the value is going down.\",\n          \"Good morning, Noel and Georges.  First of all, congratulations for this good set of results.  I just have one broader question on growth and one follow -up on deposits.  Just looking at the much -improved profitability levels of the group with NII being $2 -3 billion higher per quarter, despite the capacity to scale up growth.  And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium -term or starting 2024, do you see hope for the group to lean more into growth , so the single -digit loan growth could potentially be higher, or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be essentially returned to shareholders, just in terms of the trade -off between opportunity for gr owing more versus shareholder return s? And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of HSBC\\u2019s deposit franchise during the quarter.  Have you seen, in  particular , inflows in certain parts of  your footprint  helping  delivering stable deposit s in the quarter?  Also wondering with regards to  deposit migration  \\u2013 part of moving into time deposits, or whether you have seen any change in trend.  Are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration, or could we still go on for another quarter?

I just have one broader question on growth and one follow -up on deposits.  Just looking at the much -improved profitability levels of the group with NII being $2 -3 billion higher per quarter, despite the capacity to scale up growth.  And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium -term or starting 2024, do you see hope for the group to lean more into growth , so the single -digit loan growth could potentially be higher, or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be essentially returned to shareholders, just in terms of the trade -off between opportunity for gr owing more versus shareholder return s? And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of HSBC\\u2019s deposit franchise during the quarter.  Have you seen, in  particular , inflows in certain parts of  your footprint  helping  delivering stable deposit s in the quarter?  Also wondering with regards to  deposit migration  \\u2013 part of moving into time deposits, or whether you have seen any change in trend.  Are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration, or could we still go on for another quarter?

I just have one broader question on growth and one follow -up on deposits.  Just looking at the much -improved profitability levels of the group with NII being $2 -3 billion higher per quarter, despite the capacity to scale up growth.  And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium -term or starting 2024, do you see hope for the group to lean more into growth , so the single -digit loan growth could potentially be higher, or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be essentially returned to shareholders, just in terms of the trade -off between opportunity for gr owing more versus shareholder return s? And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of HSBC\\u2019s deposit franchise during the quarter.  Have you seen, in  particular , inflows in certain parts of  your footprint  helping  delivering stable deposit s in the quarter?  Also wondering with regards to  deposit migration  \\u2013 part of moving into time deposits, or whether you have seen any change in trend.  Are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration, or could we still go on for another quarter?

But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic \\u2013 it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.

        "# **7. Conclusion & Key Findings**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook presented an end-to-end workflow for **topic modelling of bank earnings call transcripts**, aligned to **PRA risk categories**. Using transformer-based embeddings and BERTopic, we extracted semantically rich themes from unstructured text, and then linked them to supervisory domains for interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Technical Approach\n",
        "- **Embedding-Based Topic Modelling**: Applied BERTopic with domain-tuned embeddings to generate high-coherence topics reflecting financial themes.  \n",
        "- **Topic Interpretation**: Refined topic labels using top terms, enabling intuitive understanding of each cluster’s semantic meaning.  \n",
        "- **Regulatory Alignment**: Mapped extracted topics to **PRA risk categories** using embedding similarity, bridging results to structured risk taxonomies.  \n",
        "- **Visual Analytics**: Developed Sankey diagrams, word clouds, and trend plots to visualise how thematic discussions flow into regulatory priorities and evolve over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Analytical Insights\n",
        "1. **Dominant Risk Themes**  \n",
        "   - Topics related to *capital adequacy, liquidity management, and credit quality* appeared most frequently across earnings calls.  \n",
        "   - This indicates a consistent supervisory and investor focus on balance sheet resilience and regulatory compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bank-Specific Focus Areas**  \n",
        "   - **JP Morgan** discussions showed strong emphasis on *capital ratios, regulatory buffers, and market outlook*.  \n",
        "   - **HSBC** exhibited greater thematic density around *operational restructuring, digital transformation, and regional liquidity trends*.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Temporal Trends**  \n",
        "   - The prominence of *credit and capital topics* fluctuated with macroeconomic uncertainty (e.g., interest rate changes, loan performance).  \n",
        "   - *Operational and governance topics* have gradually increased, reflecting supervisory attention to non-financial risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Comparison**  \n",
        "   - BERTopic outperformed classical LDA in capturing nuanced financial language and producing semantically coherent topics.  \n",
        "   - Embedding-based matching enabled a direct mapping to regulatory risk categories, improving interpretability for stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications\n",
        "This workflow demonstrates that transformer-based topic modelling can serve as a **scalable text analytics framework** for regulatory insight generation.  \n",
        "By aligning model outputs with PRA categories, the analysis bridges the gap between **qualitative disclosures** and **quantitative risk supervision**, supporting more proactive oversight and thematic intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\\\n",
        "**Next Steps**\n",
        "- Extend the analysis to additional banks for cross-institutional comparison.  \n",
        "- Automate PRA category mapping for continuous ingestion of new transcripts.\n",
        "- Integrate sentiment analysis to assess tone and forward-looking risk sentiment.  \n",
        "- Devise a system to identify evasive answers and generate a shortlist of flagged disclosures.\n",
        "- Aggregate the above results into concise, regulator-ready summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these enhancements would further evolve the model into a production-grade regulatory intelligence tool.\n"

I just wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then became co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2023,\n        \"max\": 2025,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2025\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Q2\",\n          \"Q4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_pleasantry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_pdf\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\",\n          \"data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.\",\n          \"Okay. Wait, I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact. So, that's all to the good in some sense. Now the other part of your question, can you just repeat it?

That is in part because of various things; FX is a big part of it, but also government subsidies.  How does that affect your profitability in the region?  Your volume is going up but the value is going down.\",\n          \"Good morning, Noel and Georges.  First of all, congratulations for this good set of results.  I just have one broader question on growth and one follow -up on deposits.  Just looking at the much -improved profitability levels of the group with NII being $2 -3 billion higher per quarter, despite the capacity to scale up growth.  And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium -term or starting 2024, do you see hope for the group to lean more into growth , so the single -digit loan growth could potentially be higher, or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be essentially returned to shareholders, just in terms of the trade -off between opportunity for gr owing more versus shareholder return s? And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of HSBC\\u2019s deposit franchise during the quarter.  Have you seen, in  particular , inflows in certain parts of  your footprint  helping  delivering stable deposit s in the quarter?  Also wondering with regards to  deposit migration  \\u2013 part of moving into time deposits, or whether you have seen any change in trend.  Are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration, or could we still go on for another quarter?

So somewhat flat \\u2013 just slightly up from quarter four.  That number, it is fair to annualise it, given current rate forecast consensus.  Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth growth in NNIA , in wealth \\u2013 the resumption of activity in Hong Kong in particular bodes well for the future, and I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.  On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the markets activitie s such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, may not be repeated, and obviously, we may have to look at it quarter by quarter in terms of what business opportunities are there.  And while you can bake in and factor in the results for Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualise that outperformance.  But in general, Aman, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results , and we are confident about the future, and in light of the strong Q1 performance, we will review the guidance  in H1.\",\n          \"At the end of 2022 the rate sensitivity on the downside 100 basis points scenario was reduced from around $6 billion at the half year to around $4 billion.  That $2 billion reduction, the NII sensitivity reduction of 100 basis points is for about a third of  it, justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in place or that we continued putting in place as of last year.  Two-thirds of it is due to the fact that we\\u2019re just at a higher level of rates and therefore we have less rates convexity  on the  downside. If you look into Q1 we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges.  Just as a reminder, structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity, and our target is to take that $4 bi llion in the medium term to circa $3 billion. We are on that journey.  We have certainly not arrived there.  We will be giving you an update at H1.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2023,\n        \"max\": 2025,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Q2\",\n          \"Q4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_pleasantry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_pdf\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thank you for being with us on this call today . Let me begin with the first - quarter highlights . Profit before tax was $12.9 billion, up $9 billion on the first quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis . This was driven by an $8.6 billion increase in revenue, which includes $2.1 billion from the part-reversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations in France, and a $1.5 billion provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. Credit performance was b enign, with expected credit losses of $0.4 billion . Costs were up 2% in the first quarter against our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3% on a constant currency basis and excluding notable items and hyperinflation . Our annualised return on ta ngible equity was 27.4%, or 19.3% excluding the gain on SVB UK and the part-reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank. And as Noel said, we\\u2019re providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarterly dividend since 2019 of 10 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around three months. Going into more detail, net interest income of $9 billion was up $2.9 billion or 47% on the first quarte r of 2022, and was stable on the fourth quarter on an IFRS 17 basis . Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up $5.7 billion, which includes $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in Markets and Securi ties Services , and in Wealth.  Lending balances increased by $32 billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis . This was made up of $25 billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in France, and $7.3 bil lion from SVB UK . Deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors . If we excluded these items, lending and deposits were both stable.  The tax charge of $1.9 billion included a credit of $0.4 billion . The CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was an i ncrease of 50 basis points on the fourth quarter and included the 30 -basis -point gain relating to the part-reversal of the France impairment and the SVB UK acquisition. As Noel said, all of our global businesses performed well . This slide gives you the ev idence for that. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter, with revenues up 82% . Within this, Wealth was up 13%, driven by the economic resurgence in Asia and increasing traction from the investment we\\u2019ve made in digitisation and in people . Persona l Banking also had another good quarter, up 64%, benefiting from our strong deposit franchise. Across both Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payment s Services had revenues of $4 billion, which was an increase of 176% on the first quarter of 2022 . Global  Banking and Markets also performed well overall . Markets and Securities Services revenue in particular were up 12%, with a strong performance in foreign exchange. Reported net interest income was $9 billion, which included $1.4 bil lion of interest expense due to the funding costs booked in Corporate Centre to fund the trading books . This was offset by $1.4 billion of non -net interest income reported in Corporate Centre . On a reported basis, the net interest margin was up by 50 basis  points on the first quarter of last year and up by one basis point on the fourth quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our 2022 full-year results . On an IFRS 17 basis, we expect to achieve net interest in come of at least $34 billion in 2023 . This is equivalent to at least $36 billion of net interest income on an IFRS  4 basis, which was what we told you in February . Our current view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our 2022 full -year results remain unchanged. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up substantially by $5.7 billion, which was a combination of , one,  $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter,  two, a Global Banking and Markets trading income increase of $0.4 billion, three, a $1.3 billion increase in Corporate Centre income for funding Global Banking and Markets trading activity, and , four,  other income, which grew by $0.2 billion and included higher Wealth revenues. Fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of 2022, with a good payments fee performance partially offset by lower Wealth fees . However, net new invested assets in the quarter were $22 billion, and $93 for the last 12 months, which bodes well for future growth . I called out the gl obal business revenue highlights earlier, and there is a detailed non -net income interest breakdown on slide 17. Our credit performance in the quarter was benign, with a $0.4 billion charge for expected credit losses, which was $0.2 billion lower than the  first quarter last year . This reflected a favourable shift in the probability weightings of our economic downside scenarios, as well as low stage 3 losses . China CRE was also benign, with a small charge relating to technical adjustments to two customers . We saw no China CRE defaults in the quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021, though there were also limited repayments . We are encouraged by the first quarter, but there are still downside risks, so our 2023 guidance remains unchanged, at a charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held -for-sale balances . We will review this at our interim results. On a constant currency basis and excluding notable items, costs were up 2% in the first quarter, once we  also exclude the impact of retranslating prior -year costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency . As you can see, most of this spend was on technology . We remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately 3% in 2023 on that basis. As I share d at the year -end, one of my top priorities is cost discipline . Equally, I also shared that another of my top priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns . The acquisition of SVB UK was an opportunity to do that . This is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa 1% to Group operating expenses, the majority of which is the acquired cost base of SVB UK, together with some additional investment in the UK and other geographies . This will be in addition to our 2023  target of limiting cost growth to circa 3%. Finally, at year -end, we also flagged $300 million of expected severance costs this year . A large portion of these severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter, with the cost benefits s tarting to come through in the second half of this year. Moving on, we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendi x, but we have moved it up to the presentation this time, because we appreciate the current interest . Overall, customer d eposits are stable year on year and quarter on quarter . Of the $1.6 trillion of deposits we hold, half are invested in high -quality liquid assets, which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position . This is a historic feature of the way that HSBC man ages its balance sheet, and it has not changed. Around 40% of our high -quality liquid assets are held in cash or cash equivalents . And there are only $1.4 billion of unrealised losses in our held -to-collect portfolio, which is down from around $1.9 billion at the end of 2022. Three main points on capital . One, o ur CET1 ratio is 14.7%, up 50 basis points on the previous quarter, 25 basis points of which was from the reclassification of our French retail business from held -for-sale. Pending the outcom e of negotiations for our French retail bank, there would be a commensurate reduction to CET1 in the event that the deal closes. Two, a s you know, our business in Canada remains classified as held -for-sale, and we now expect the transaction to complete in  the first quarter of 2024, as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition . We continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024 . And as previously indicated, we expect almost all excess c apital from the Canada transaction accruing into CET1 to be returned to shareholders, primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in 2024 and 2025 that would be incremental to any existing buyback programme at that time. Three, s hare buybacks rem ain an active part of our capital management plans . We will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in 2023 and beyond at our interim results. So in summary, this was a strong quarter . There was a strong profit performance . Net interest income wa s stable . Strict cost discipline was maintained, which I told you would remain a key focus area for myself and the management team . Our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook . We are starting to see the impact of strong economi c rebounds in Hong Kong and mainland China, and our Wealth strategy is gaining traction . And I am pleased there were strong capital returns, a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after  the AGM and complete in around three months. As Noel said, we are clearly on track to meet our returns target for 2023 onwards, and this upward trajectory will give us substantial distribution capacity, including, of course, the potential proceeds from t he Canada transaction.
